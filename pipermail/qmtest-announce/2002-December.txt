Subject: QMTest 2.0 Released
Message-ID: <8610000.1038847557@warlock.codesourcery.com>

QMTest 2.0 is now available from:

  http://www.codesourcery.com/qm/qmtest_download

Most of the changes from the 1.1 series fall into two categories:

- Internal improvements.

  With this release, the QMTest APIs and file formats should be stable.

  A goal for this release was to provide solid infrastructure atop which
  we could build more interesting test classes, reporting machinery, and
  so forth.

  Almost all of the file formats have changed.  We believe the new
  formats are simpler and more powerful.  QMTest should be able to
  continue to read the old file formats, but can only write the new
  file formats.  That means that if you upgrade to QMTest 2.0 and edit
  your test database, you may not be able to downgrade.  If you're
  worried about that, make a copy first.

- Bug fixes.

  We have made the internal execution engine more robust, made the basic
  test classes behave more consistently across platforms, and fixed a
  variety of crashes throughout the code.

We expect that the next major release will add more test classes and
more reporting functionality.
