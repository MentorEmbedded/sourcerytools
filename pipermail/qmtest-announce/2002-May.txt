Subject: QMTest 1.1.4
Message-ID: <23220000.1021488480@gandalf.codesourcery.com>

QMTest 1.1.4 is now available at:

  http://www.codesourcery.com/qm/qmtest

This release contains a few bug fixes for usability issues, including:

  The QMTest GUI no longer crashes when the "Cancel" button is hit when
  creating a new test suite.

  Commands like "qmtest create-tdb --attribute X=Y" where "Y" contains
  spaces are now handled correctly.

Also, the Windows QMTest binaries are now built with Python 2.2, since
many QMTest users have indicated that they have upgraded to that version
of Python.
