Subject: QMTest 2.4 released
Message-ID: <47010BF4.9050700@codesourcery.com>

I'm pleased to announce the QMTest 2.4 release, available
for download from http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest/2.4/download.html.

This release contains a number of major improvements
relative to QMTest 2.3, notably:


*  A new "expectation_database" extension kind has been added, with two
   built-in implementations, previous_testrun.PreviousTestRun, and
   xml_expectation_database.XMLExpectationDatabase. The command-line
   interface has been enhanced to support this.

*  A new CompilationTestDatabase has been added, and various related
   test classes and utility functions have been improved to support it.

*  The QMTest documentation has been much improved. The tutorial has been
   restructured to contain three chapters:
   1) concepts, 2) customization, 3) extension.

*  Changes have been made to make QMTest work with Python 2.5.

*  QMTest now installs its data into <prefix>/share/qmtest, and its
   documentation into <prefix>/share/doc/qmtest.
