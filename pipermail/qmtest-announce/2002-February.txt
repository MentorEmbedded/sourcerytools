Subject: QMTest 1.1.1 Released
Message-ID: <1170000.1013712464@localhost>

QMTest 1.1.1 is now available at:

  http://www.codesourcery.com/qm/qmtest

This version contains a number of bug fixes and improvements.

Because of bugs in Python 1.5.2 that occur when using both threads
and fork/exec, QMTest now requires Python 2.1 or higher.  We believe
that this change will make QMTest more reliable.
