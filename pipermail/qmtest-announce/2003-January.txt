Subject: QMTest 2.0.2 Released
Message-ID: <200301130840.h0D8eZR01253@localhost.localdomain>


QMTest 2.0.2 has been released.

This release contains a few improvements and defect corrections
relative to QMTest 2.0.1.

* When a test fails due to dependency on a resource that could not be
  set up, the GUI now displays a link to the resource result from the
  test result.  (Previously, there was no way to get information about
  resource failures in the GUI.)

* The GUI now offers a choice of available prerequisite tests and
  resources when editing a test.

* The substitutions field for the FileContentsTest now works correctly
  in the GUI.  This is an incompatible change; tests that use this test
  class will require hand-editing.

* An argument in a derived test or resource class which has the same
  name as an argument in a base class now overrides the base class
  argument.  Therefore, every test class will have only one argument
  with a given name.  (Previously, both the base and derived class
  arguments were present.)

The new release is available at:

We are also working on more extensive improvements for the 2.1 release
series; stay tuned!
