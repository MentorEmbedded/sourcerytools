Subject: QMTest 2.1.1 Released
Message-ID: <4033A6DC.40302@codesourcery.com>

QMTest 2.1.1 is a bug-fix only release that corrects two defects under 
Windows:

* ShellScriptTest did not work correctly under Windows due to 
differences in the way that the Windows command interpreter operates.

* The TimeoutExecutable class (used by some QMTest built-in test classes 
and other add-on packages) crashed on Windows when the program to be 
executed did not exist in the file system.

We will continue to make QMTest 2.1.x releases for ciritical defects, 
but no new features will be added.  New features will appear in QMTest 2.2.

See:

for download information.

Subject: QMTest 2.1.2 Released
Message-ID: <200402272224.i1RMO1fW000857@sirius.codesourcery.com>


The QMTest 2.1.2 release contains only one change relative to 2.2.1.
The change corrects packaging mistake in the QMTest 2.1.1 release that
affected the Windows binaries.  The 2.1.1 release binaries failed to
include the qmtest.py driver script.

There is no reason to upgrade to this release if you are on a
non-Windows system.
