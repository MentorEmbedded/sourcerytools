Subject: QMTest 2.0.3 Released
Message-ID: <1046158501.11789.294.camel@doubledemon.codesourcery.com>

QMTest 2.0.3 has been released.

This is a bug-fix release with fixes for exactly two bugs:

  A JavaScript issue that prevented the pop-up menus in the GUI from
  working correctly with Mozilla 1.0.1 was corrected.

  A bug that could cause QMTest to hang when running tests in parallel
  has been corrected.

The release is available here:

For this release, the GNU/Linux binaries and RPMS were built on a
Red Hat 8.0 machine, rather than a Red Hat 7.x machine.

If you would like a Red Hat 7.x RPM, let me know -- we can build those
binaries too, if there is still demand.
