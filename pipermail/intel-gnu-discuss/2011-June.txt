Message-ID: <CA0BF1B3.56166%maarten.koning@windriver.com>

Hi, I am interested in IA32 bare metal support.

This page http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/ia32 mentions bare metal support for ia32 is coming soon.

Is there opportunity to get more information on when and what it will contain?

Thanks?Maarten
