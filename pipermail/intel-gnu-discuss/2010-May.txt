Subject: Using Linux gcc on windows for none-linux (RT)OS
Message-ID: <4BE0754F.7070702@sciopta.com>

Hi,

instead of rolling my own GCC I'd like to use the pre-build (and tested)
version from CodeSourcery for my RTOS.

Some basics are clear to me, I will have to set -nostdlib and
-nostartfiles option. So that the linker will not pull in glibc.
Anything else ?

Instead glibc I need to build a newlib, but is this possible with the gcc
targeted to Linux ?

Any hint/link is appreciated.

Great. But Atom only ? No multilib option ?

Yes, Atom-only.  If you are interested in a services engagement to provide 
tools for another board or processor, or would be interested in having 
supported Sourcery G++ releases for bare-metal IA32 on particular 
processors, please contact sales at codesourcery.com.  Customer demand for 
particular features is taken into consideration in planning our supported 
Sourcery G++ releases; the libraries included in the unsupported Lite 
Edition tools are those agreed with the CPU architecture partners.

:-) IA32 would be personal interest, nothing for the sales-guys.

Ah, the libraries. Only newlib or also libgcc ?

But the compiler could generate IA32 code ?

I am just thinking if I go the easy way, or just compile GCC myself.

The compiler will be configured --with-arch=atom, meaning that newlib, 
libgcc and libstdc++ will all be built for Atom.  Of course you can use 
other -march options - but there won't be associated non-Atom libraries.
