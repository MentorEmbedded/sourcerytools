Subject: mrh73 option with IA32 compiler
Message-ID: <AANLkTimGUJshvbFmbka3cCFei-wbhJv24q3OhP4hwX_V@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When i see the sources that i downloaded from the
http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/ia32/portal/release1567
i see that there is an undocumented option 'mrh73' in cs-linux.opt
file. But the binaries of the lite version from the same page doesn't
give this option. I get the following error:
$ i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc -mrh73 test.c
cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-mrh73"

Is this option not available in the lite binaries?

Regards,
Shafi
