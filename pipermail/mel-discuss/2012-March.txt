Subject: [mel-discuss] wireless setup for PandaBoard ?
Message-ID: <4F4FAB25.9000501@mentor.com>

Hello,

now that I have successfully the MEL kit on the PandaBoard, I'd like to
switch to wireless communication. Are there any simple steps to follow
to enable that ? Notably, does the kernel already have all the required
modules built in ?

Thanks,
		Stefan

Subject: [mel-discuss] BeagleBoard-XM booting problem
Message-ID: <CAMWd8HBWa5cHiQX-=9PL0RTgERfadm6TUs4wM9JJ-GqyL7WZtA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am quite new to linux development. I downloaded the installer yesterday
and followed the instructions outlined in the quick start guide. But I am
not able to bootup. I am using a Beagle-XM revC board. (the board works
fine with the shipped angstrom image)

My first error was the "could not find /boot/uImage". I resolved this by
following both the workarounds mentioned in a previous thread (
http://sourcerytools.com/pipermail/mel-discuss/2012-February/000006.html),
after this now I get an error - "wrong image type for bootm command". Could
anyone tell me how to fix this? My full log is below:

Govind,

  It is difficult to tell from the information that you attached where the specific cause of the problem is coming from.

  There are two probable areas to check though:

1)    Make sure you imaged the card correctly.  This causes most errors booting.

2)    Make sure that you created the boot.scr correctly.  (Please review the docs)

  If you have done both of those steps, then you can also share the contents of the mmc device and the script.

Regards,
     Sean

Hi Govind:

You might check that uImage is actually the kernel image,
uImage-beagleboard.bin. Looking at the console output below,
it appears that uImage is not the kernel image file,
uImage-beagleboard.bin but the u-boot file, u-boot.img. You
can tell by looking at the "Image Name: U-Boot 2011.12-dirty for beagle"
It should actually be "Image Name:   Mentor Embedded Linux/3.0.17/bea".

Instead of autobooting, you can manually boot your board by doing:

OMAP3 beagleboard.org # mmc rescan
OMAP3 beagleboard.org # fatload mmc 0:1 0x80200000 uImage
reading uImage

3356360 bytes read
OMAP3 beagleboard.org # bootm 0x80200000
## Booting kernel from Legacy Image at 80200000 ...
    Image Name:   Mentor Embedded Linux/3.0.17/bea
    Image Type:   ARM Linux Kernel Image (uncompressed)
    Data Size:    3356296 Bytes = 3.2 MiB
    Load Address: 80008000
    Entry Point:  80008000
    Verifying Checksum ... OK
    Loading Kernel Image ... OK
OK

Starting kernel ...

Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel.


Hope that helps...

Hi Scott / Sean,

Thanks for your replies and a thousand apologies for the silly goof up :).
I must have made some mistake while renaming the uIimage file. So now once
I loaded the proper image, I was able to successfully boot and log in to
linux!

By the way, does this build have a GUI - I couldnt see anything on the DVI
monitor (unlike the default angstrom builds) - I could only see output on
the UART terminal ?

Govind,

While the MEL Kit images are command line only, you should have seen a
login prompt on the monitor.

I noticed that there was no output on the monitor if I connected the
monitor after the board was powered on, but if the monitor was
connected before I powered on the board, I did see monitor output.

Hope that helps,

Hello Stefan,

Just to confirm, I don't see that wireless is enabled on any of the
interfaces:

     root at pandaboard:~# iwconfig
     lo        no wireless extensions.

     usb0      no wireless extensions.

     sit0      no wireless extensions.

     ip6tnl0   no wireless extensions.

     usb1      no wireless extensions.

and nothing that looks like a wireless kernel module is loaded:

     root at pandaboard:~# lsmod
     Module                  Size  Used by
     ircomm_tty             15903  0
     ircomm                  7956  1 ircomm_tty
     irda                   90573  2 ircomm_tty,ircomm

I'll poke around a bit more, but I think the answer is no, there are
no simple steps to enable wireless out of the box.

Thanks,

Stefan,

I've managed to get wireless enabled by using a different kernel with
the MEL Kit root filesystem on the PandaBoard.

Following these instructions:

     http://elinux.org/Panda_How_to_kernel_3_3_rel

In short:

     1. Get the linux 3.3 kernel sources.

     2. Apply the 0001a-omap4-pandaboard-wlan-fix.patch patch.

     3. Build the kernel and modules and copy them onto the board's boot
        media.

     4. Copy the wireless firmware to the board's root filesystem.

     5. Configure wireless in /etc/wpa_suplicant.conf.

     6. Boot the board.  Note that the kernel argument for the root
     filesystem changed from 'root=/dev/sda2' to 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2'
     in going from the 2.6 kernel that ships with the MEL Kit to the 3.3
     kernel.  The kernel parameter 'rootdelay=10' was also helpful.

The result is a working wireless network, with some console warning
messages and kernel tracebacks from time to time:

Keep in mind that this exercise is a proof of concept: Wireless can be
made to work on this board.  People interested in working with and
extending a similar environment themselves should be using the yocto
framework here: http://yoctoproject.org/.  People interested in
commercial support should contact our sales team or visit us on the web:

Ricardo,

that's excellent news; thanks for following up. I will try out these
instructions as soon as I get a chance.

Thanks,
		Stefan
