Hi all,

The first mail entry to a new list is always interesting.  Chances are, you will only read this email from the archives.  :)

Mentor Embedded (part of Mentor Graphics) recently announced the availability of its new Embedded Linux Kit.  This download is absolutely free and available to anyone that would like to tinker with a prebuilt, Yocto-based image set for both the BeagleBoard and the PandaBoard.  Each kit also contains a Sourcery CodeBench Lite (integrated cross toolchain), a set of libraries/headers for applications development, and a quick start guide that should get you started right out of the box.

For those that did not find out about this mailing list via the MEL Kit web page, check it out at:

http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/downloads/linux-kits/

The entire Mentor Embedded Linux engineering team is hanging out on mel-discuss.  If you have any questions about MEL Kit or Mentor Embedded Linux, use mel-discuss to go to the source (so to speak).

Cheers!

A note from the quickstart guide that might be handy if you are having difficulties auto-booting from uboot...

If the board does not boot up, issue the following commands when booting stops:
OMAP3 beagleboard.org # mmc rescan ${mmcdev}; fatload mmc ${mmcdev} ${loadaddr} uImage

If you are looking for a more automated workaround here are a couple.
After following either set of instructions below, your board should just
boot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workaround #1: Put the uImage file where u-boot expects it

In the boot messages you can see that u-boot is looking for the uImage
kernel file in /boot/uImage on the second partition of the mmc card:

     Relevant uImage Boot Error
     Loading file "/boot/uImage" from mmc device 0:2 (xxa2)
     ** File not found /boot/uImage

The workaround is to put a copy of the uImage kernel file where u-boot
expects it:

     # mount /dev/sdc2 sdc2
     # cp -f <mel-kit>/beagleboard/binary/uImage-beagleboard.bin /mnt/sdc2/boot/uImage

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workaround #2: Use uEnv.txt and boot.scr to get u-boot to read the
uImage file from the first partition

In the boot messages you can see that u-boot tries to load a file called
uEnv.txt:

     reading uEnv.txt
     ** Unable to read "uEnv.txt" from mmc 0:1 **

Create a uEnv.txt and boot.scr on the first partition of the mmc card as
shown below:

     uEnv.txt
     bootenv=boot.scr
     loaduimage=fatload mmc ${mmcdev} ${loadaddr} ${bootenv}
     mmcboot=echo Running boot.scr script from mmc ...; source ${loadaddr}

See also, http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=1940

The contents of the boot.scr.txt input come from the workaround
instructions for non-booting boards in the MEL-KIT for beagleboard
installation and quick start guide page 8 section titled "Booting the
BeagleBoard with MEL kit":

     mmc rescan ${mmcdev}; fatload mmc ${mmcdev} ${loadaddr} uImage
     setenv bootargs console=${console} ${optargs} mpurate=${mpurate} buddy=${buddy} buddy2=${buddy2} camera=${camera} vram=${vram} omapfb.mode=dvi:${dvimode} omapdss.def_disp=${defaultdisplay} root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=${mmcrootfstype}
     bootm ${loadaddr}

Then make the boot.scr:

     # mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -a 0 -e 0 -n "Pandaboard boot script" -d boot.scr.txt boot.scr

Then copy uEnv.txt and boot.scr onto the first partition of your card:

     # mount /dev/sdc1 sdc1
     # cp -f boot.scr uEnv.txt /mnt/sdc2

I'm booting fine on a Beagleboard[1], but I noticed that it's not 
automatically configuring USB networking. Are we missing the 
usb-gadget-mode[2] package, or is there some other way this should be 
working?

[1] It's actually a beagleboard C3, though the release notes say only C4 
is "supported".

Message-ID: <43AE86686954984BA6E949465D98484089E49DA2@NA-MBX-03.mgc.mentorg.com>

Last week, we announced the MEL Kit support for both the BeagleBoard and the PandaBoard.   This week, we are announcing the availability of MEL Kits for emulated target environments.   This should be handy for those that want to check out CodeBench Lite or MEL Lite, but you lack hardware.   These MEL Kits for QEMU are absolutely free and available to anyone that would like to tinker with a prebuilt, Yocto-based image set for the following emulation environments:

QEMU for ARM
QEMU for MIPS
QEMU for Freescale Power
QEMU for Intel x86

Each kit contains a Sourcery CodeBench Lite (integrated cross toolchain), a set of libraries/headers for applications development, and a quick start guide that should get you started right out of the box.

I'd like to build the Mentor Embedded Linux Kit for the PandaBoard

3a4401a2e62b5bfab90cc8fa15702c11ca8591f0).  I see that the source

Message-ID: <4F4C32B1.4040100@codesourcery.com>

Hello,

I have just downloaded the MEL kit for PandaBoard (from
http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/downloads/linux-kits/) and
attempted to install it on my Fedora 16 laptop.

Unfortunately the process wasn't quite as smooth as I had hoped. In
particular, the installer tries to determine whether all prerequisites
are installed. In my case, that's (lines 228 et seqq.):

     lib1=`yum list glibc | grep 'i[0-9]86' | grep -e "installed"`
     lib2=`yum list *gtk* | grep 'i[0-9]86' | grep -e "installed"`
     if [ -z "$lib1" ] || [ -z "$lib2" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: 32-bit libraries required for this installer are
missing. Please follow instructions below and restart the installer."
        ...

when the actual output of `yum list glibc` would be:

glibc.i686    2.14.90-24.fc16.6    @updates
glibc.x86_64  2.14.90-24.fc16.6    @updates

and likewise that of `yum list "*gtk*"`.
Knowing that my system provided those prerequisites, I simply commented
out the two bad lines in the installer, and everything ran to completion.

Thanks,
		Stefan

Note that this only covers building the kernel from source. The copyleft_sources are the sources + patch series necessary to give you the source to everything which was built. The layers for use with yocto/poky which correspond to the MEL Kit release haven't been released yet, as far as I'm aware.

Denver,

The MEL Kit is a prebuilt image for PandaBoard (and BeagleBoard).  The sources are included to satisfy any copyleft requirements, but are not really set up for building (no bitbake in MEL Kit and no metadata).

I would suggest using the yoctoproject.org build environment (Yocto/poky) if you would like to actually produce/modify a kernel and/or modify the root filesystem for your PandaBoard.  You could also move a commercial yocto-based distribution as a base for specific customizations, but I suspect you are simply in the evaluation phase of your project.

John

I see where you are going here.  MEL Kit documentation states that a prerequisite is a Linux host.  Since MEL Kit was prebuilt, eliminating most of the host dependencies, it was tested on Ubuntu 10.04 as the main host.  We really need to update the docs to clarify this.

Thanks for workaround Stefan.  There may be other Fedora users that run into the same issue.
