<PRE>Hi,

I did not find a definitive source on the net (due to lots of false
positives when googling), but I found this list that seems to discuss
C++ / pthread library issues.

My question is simple: Does the combination of C++98 and Posix pthread
standards give any guarantee that the operator new is &quot;thread safe&quot;,
means that several threads can allocate objects via &quot;new&quot; concurrently
without explicit locking by the user code? 

Our current research seems to indicate that pthread standards don't
mention C++ in any way, and C++ does not mention threads, and it is
pure benevolence (or plain sanity?) of the implementations I have seen
up to now to provide a thread safe implementation of new (mostly based
on a global lock).

Some pointers to mandatory sources or better places to discuss this
issue are welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Markus
