</I>Sometimes I'm guilty of writing far too much detail, and I've learned to 
try to keep it simple and direct, at least &quot;most of the time&quot;, and then 
I always get hit with a complaint that I didn't cover all the bases. You 
really can't win, can you? ;-)

Yes, of course there are exceptions; mostly in outer level control 
structures, though, not in the inner depths of a library. I've always 
argued it should be POSSIBLE to finalize any exception, including 
cancel; and in fact that's one of the major reasons I've always felt 
that cancel should BE an exception, since the syntax is already there.

The issue we've been discussing is not whether there are exceptions, or 
where they are, but rather how to &quot;warp&quot; our basic theoretically clean 
model to deal with the reality that C++ libraries (including STL) are 
rife with arbitrary catch(...) blocks that stop exceptions; often with 
no really supportable reason except that it seemed convenient at the 
time. Most of this code should NOT be continuing when an exception 
occurs they can't directly finalize; they should be passing it on to 
someone who can. That might be some outer scope that really understands 
the exception, or it might be some &quot;failsafe catchall&quot; in the main 
program loop like you're describing. We can keep this inner code from 
seeing cancel, we can keep it from catching it, we can re-raise cancel 
after the catch, or we can just let it trash the cancel and force the 
code to be fixed if the user really wants that thread to be cancellable 
while in the library.

Note that my (hypothetical, simply for the purposes of abstract 
consideration) proposal for dynamic cancel scoping based (at least 
partly) on exception constructs, would result in cancel being completely 
disabled in any thread run by your &quot;recover at all costs&quot; main loop; 
because the entire call tree would be inside a catch(...) scope. The 
question is whether that's bad. The thread presumably was never 
cancellable before, unless it was designed for a POSIX implementation 
where C++ and POSIX cancel interoperate reasonably well (which doesn't 
leave many implementations). So it wouldn't be cancellable in the new 
&quot;c++-pthreads&quot; model, either, without some code changes. That doesn't 
sound like a big deal. If you WANT it to be cancellable, you could 
enable it by simply adding an explicit catch for the cancel exception to 
that try block. That's trivial compared to the work required just to 
check whether the rest of the threads' call stacks are cancel-safe.
