To some extent I don't think anyone knows them.  This is a group that 
consists of people from a lot of different places; some of the people 
on this list, by no means all, attend C++ committee meetings.

The origin of this discussion was on the GCC mailing list, when people 
were trying to figure out how gcc, glibc, and libstdc++ should handle 
the intersection of C++ and pthreads.  People in that discussion 
realized that this was a discussion that extended beyond the GNU 
community and that a solution adopted by gcc/linux wouldn't be nearly 
as interesting as a solution that was generally recognized as right.

In the end, &quot;generally recognized as right&quot; probably means getting 
approval from the C++ committee and/or The Austin Group.  But that's 
for another day.

My goals are (I believe) very similar to yours: figure out what the 
POSIX C binding should mean for C++.  This might mean something as 
ambitious as coming up with a separate C++ binding, or it might mean 
making some minor tweaks and clarifications in the existing C binding 
and/or the existing C++ language specification.  In principle I'm 
agnostic between the two.  In practice I suspect we don't have the 
resources or the vendor buy-in to do anything extremely ambitious.
