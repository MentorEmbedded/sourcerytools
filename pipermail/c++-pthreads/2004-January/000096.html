I, at least, have no trouble with the idea of using C++ exceptions to
report cancellation.  In fact, I think it's a great idea in general.
It's just a really bad idea for functions which can normally be
expected never to throw exceptions to start throwing cancellations
when used in a POSIX threads environment.

IIUC, other &quot;C++ people&quot; who don't like the idea of printf throwing
an exception feel the same way.
