<PRE>I've been debating whether to stay silent and merely suspect I'm an 
idiot, or to open my mouth and remove all doubt...

Basic question:  Are we trying to solve a problem that really exists?

I'm putting aside for the moment asynchronous cancelation as once you 
get into that you give up all hope of releasing resources.  For now I'm 
simply discussing deferred cancelation.

In C you need an organized system in which to register cleanup handlers 
to release resources in case a thread is canceled.  You also need a way 
to temporarily disable cancelations.  And finally you need a mechanism 
by which a thread can be notified that someone has requested 
cancelation.  The POSIX lib neatly supplies all of these requirements.

In C++ we have such a different environment than in C that I am 
questioning whether there is a need for a library supported cancelation 
mechanism in the first place.  One thread can easily request another 
thread to cancel itself via a reference to a shared variable (which 
need not be global).  As long as the &quot;cancelation mechanism&quot; is via a 
thrown exception, there is no need for cleanup handlers.  And since a 
thread can manually check whether its cancel variable has been set or 
not, there is no need to disable cancelations (the thread simply 
doesn't check whether it has been canceled if it isn't willing to 
cancel itself).

In other words, the C++ language makes it so easy to write &quot;cancelable 
threads&quot; and &quot;cancel-safe code&quot;, are we making an easy problem hard by 
trying to code a solution into a library?

For example below is a simple multi-thread helloworld using 
Metrowerks::threads (think boost::threads) where the main thread 
creates and then cancels a couple of worker threads.  Resources are 
acquired and released properly, not due to the Metrowerks::threads lib, 
but due to the C++ language itself (RAII and basic exception safety).

One might point out that the demo below relies on polling to detect 
thread cancelation, and this is true.  But pthread cancellation also 
seems to rely on polling, so &lt;shrug&gt;.

The demo also avoids global variables to communicate cancelation to the 
threads by using function objects instead of functions (a technique 
unavailable to the C programmer).  And of course, the use of exceptions 
and (basic) exception-safe code eliminates the need for cleanup 
handlers (also unavailable to the C programmer).

So is the solution we're designing here somehow superior to what the 
C++ programmer can easily do for himself already?  I'm merely asking, 
I'm not claiming to know the answer to that question.

     }
