<PRE>I think this is an appropriate time to restate my proposal.  I think
there's a fair amount of consensus around these three points:

 * Cancellation is a normal exception.
 * If a cancellation exception is destroyed, the cancellation request
   is re-entered, and acted on again at the next cancellation point.
 * Cancellation is disabled during unwinding.

But there are still some open questions:

 * Which of the POSIX cancellation points are cancellation points in C++?

None of the mandatory cancellation points are mentioned in the C++
standard, so I don't see any reason to prevent them from throwing
cancellation in C++ code.

POSIX also says that the C standard I/O functions may be cancellation
points, while the C++ standard says that they don't throw.  This
contradiction can be resolved either by allowing them to throw cancellation
or declaring that they are not cancellation points when called from C++
code; if we choose the latter, an implementation could just change them to
never be cancellation points, since that is allowed by POSIX.

Dave Butenhof mentioned that on Tru64 printf is not a cancellation point,
to avoid having to deal with cleaning up internal state.  But what about
scanf, which can block?  One of the convenient things about pthread
cancellation is that it wakes up a blocked thread.  Does this not happen on
Tru64 if the thread is using stdio functions?

My preference is still to amend the C++ standard to allow stdio functions
to throw cancellation.

 * Which bits of the C++ library are cancellation points?

I would think pretty much all I/O code, and nothing else.

Closely related to this is the question of what happens if a cancellation
exception is thrown under a formatted I/O function; currently it would be
caught and discarded, so it would only escape on a flush or the like.  I
think it should escape from formatted I/O as well.  This could be
implemented by explicitly rethrowing cancel, by limiting the set of
exceptions trapped, or by calling pthread_testcancel after the try/catch
block.

If formatted I/O functions continue to trap cancellation exceptions, they
would not be cancellation points; a cancellation point in the C++ binding
would be a function which can throw a cancellation exception.

 * Should cancellation also be disabled in destructors run during normal
   execution?  In catch blocks?

IMO, no and no.

 * How can C++ code interact with a cancellation exception?

I think everyone agrees that it should be possible to catch a cancel by
name.  We still need to specify that name and any additional operations the
cancel object might support.

 * What about pthread_exit?

I'm happy with the g++ status quo whereby destroying a pthread_exit
exception calls terminate.  Unlike cancellation, the position of a call to
pthread_exit is deterministic, so the user is responsible for making sure
that it can propagate.

Anything else?

Jason
