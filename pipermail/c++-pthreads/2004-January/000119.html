I can't speak for what you would call cancellation-safe, but the 
POSIX C binding committee certainly calls libraries with that property 
cancellation-safe.

&gt;<i> So even if code has been written to be thread-safe, you need to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps we need to talk about two different kinds of cancellation

</I>&gt;<i> cancellation safe&quot;.  For the former, you'd be guaranteed that it was

</I>&gt;<i> the cancellation request might be delayed indefinitely or ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> For the latter, you'd be guaranteed that it was OK to send a
</I>&gt;<i> cancellation request, and in addition there would be a guarantee that
</I>&gt;<i> the cancellation request would be acted on in a finite amount of time,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using this terminology, my point above is that thread safety does not

</I>
It seems the POSIX people (wisely) gave up on defining any concept of 
your strong-cancellation-safety.  Consider that in C code, even 
ensuring garden-variety cancellation safety is a hit-or-miss affair: 
cancellation handlers are subject to rot under the best circumstances.  

We have better prospects in C++, if we can, as it were, hitch the 
cancellation-safety wagon to the exception-safety horse.  Well-written 
exception handling code (i.e. implemented mainly in destructors) is 
much less subject to rot, being exercised on each block exit.  Many 
more people know how to write exception-safe C++ code than C 
cancellation-safe code.  (I'm not sure I would be able to write the 
latter, maintainably.  C simply lacks the tools for it.)
