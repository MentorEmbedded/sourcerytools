</I>
IMO, the problem with Jason's model is that it only protects against 
*some* cases where exceptions escape from destructors:

* Jason wrote that cancellation will not be disabled when a destructor 
is run during normal (non-unwinding) execution.  In that case - likely 
the most common one - a cancellation exception may be thrown, and will 
escape.

* Many cancellation points are I/O primitives, and I/O operations are 
sources of runtime errors; many C++ libraries report such errors by 
throwing exceptions.  In other words: if we can expect a cancellation 
exception, we should probably expect other kinds of exceptions too. 
Obviously, these exceptions will also escape.

So again, if we're determined not to let exceptions escape, we need a 
catch-and-finalize block.  It seems to me that automatically disabling 
cancellation while unwinding may result in a false sense of security.
