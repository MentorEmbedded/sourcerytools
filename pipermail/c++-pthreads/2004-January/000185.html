Too naturally, IMO.  There seems to be a substantial amount of C++ code out
there which traps and finalizes all exceptions, some of it in the C++
standard library I/O classes.  I disagree with this design, and propose to
change it in the message cited above, but it's just one example.  I don't
think it's reasonable for a cancellation request to be silently discarded
just because the thread was in the middle of doing some formatted output
when the cancel was received.

I wouldn't object to a facility for explicitly abandoning the cancel, but I
think that allowing it to fall out of the model is far too fragile.

&gt;<i> Besides, &quot;reasserting cancel&quot; in all the right places and no other places
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like one of those projects that ends up being a lot more subtle
</I>&gt;<i> and error-prone than anyone ever expects. ;-)
</I>
Assuming support for abanoning the cancel, why would it be more complex than

  pthread_cancel (pthread_self ());

?
