</I>Well, perhaps there might have been just a tiny element of disingenuity 
in my paragraph; though I'd prefer to call it &quot;tact&quot; in this instance, 
that distinction may not really be justifiable. I really do think that 
IF there are any predefined requirements and constraints, either they 
need to be explicitly layed out for us &quot;outsiders&quot;, or they need to be 
set aside entirely for these discussions, because we can't be expected 
to know them.

On the other hand, I had already assumed everything you've stated above, 
and to some extent I suppose I was just teasing Nathan. I really don't 
like being called, even by implication, &quot;irresponsible&quot;, (or 
&quot;disingenuous&quot;) simply on the basis that I happen to disagree with one 
individual's opinion. For giving into that base temptation at 
retribution, I must sincerely apologize to all. Even to Nathan. ;-)

&gt;<i>At any rate, I've found your contributions to this discussion highly
</I>&gt;<i>instructive.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thank you.
