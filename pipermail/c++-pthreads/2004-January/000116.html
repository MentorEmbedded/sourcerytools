Thread-safe code which may perform unbounded computation without encountering
a cancellation-point is not what I would call cancellation-safe.

So even if code has been written to be thread-safe, you need to analyze it
in detail in order to be sure that it will be properly cancellation-safe.

Perhaps we need to talk about two different kinds of cancellation safety;
I'll call them &quot;weakly cancellation safe&quot; and &quot;strongly cancellation safe&quot;.
For the former, you'd be guaranteed that it was OK to send a cancellation
request to threads running such code, but the cancellation request
might be delayed indefinitely or ignored.  For the latter, you'd be
guaranteed that it was OK to send a cancellation request, and in
addition there would be a guarantee that the cancellation request would
be acted on in a finite amount of time, i.e. that the cancelled thread
would actually terminate.  (Suggestions on terminology welcome.
Are there existing terms for these notions?)

Using this terminology, my point above is that thread safety does not
imply strong cancellation safety.
