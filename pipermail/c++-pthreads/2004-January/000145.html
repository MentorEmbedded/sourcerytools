Indeed. For a C++ POSIX binding, I would assume you might want to make
such a function throw an exception caught by the thread-creation
function to unwind properly the stack. Or is this some kind of wild
stupid idea ?

&gt;<i> &gt;2) &quot;outside cancelation&quot;: There are two kinds of &quot;outside cancelation&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	2.1) &quot;async cancelation&quot;: The OS removes the thread from its list of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;tasks to schedule and does nothing to cleanup the thread ressources.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This is the most extreme useless feature of a thread library. BeOS and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;win32 provide it. POSIX does not provide it.
</I>
I should add: win32 (TerminateThread), BeOS (kill_thread).

&gt;<i> POSIX already defines &quot;async cancel&quot;, as a mode where posting a cancel 
</I>&gt;<i> to a thread will cause the cancellation to be delivered at any arbitrary 
</I>&gt;<i> time supported by the OS and hardware. (Usually on the next clock tick, 
</I>&gt;<i> though that's a &quot;common implementation&quot; rather than any rule or even 
</I>&gt;<i> recommendation.)
</I>
OK. I guess this definition of &quot;POSIX async cancel&quot; was already
explained on the list before but I missed it. I believe this POSIX async
cancel is similar enough (at least, it feels as unsafe to use) to
&quot;abort&quot; that we could count it in section 2.1. What do you think ?

&gt;<i> &quot;Cancellation&quot; (both deferred and async) come from the Digital &quot;CMA&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> architecture (where it was called &quot;alert&quot;). The CMA concept derives from 
</I>&gt;<i> a less structured (but fundamentally similar) capability in the SRC 
</I>&gt;<i> research labs' Topaz thread package.
</I>
Do you know of other widely used system-level APIs which provide similar
features ?

&gt;<i> &gt;Definition &quot;Posix thread-safety&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;---------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;A library is &quot;posix thread-safe&quot; if it is thread-safe and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;defered-cancelation-safe.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't tack cancel-safety onto thread-safety so intimately, although 
</I>
I used the POSIX name because I thought it was the only widely deployed
system which provides this service. Maybe we should rename this to
&quot;strong thread-safety&quot;. Maybe &quot;defered-cancel thread-safety&quot; ?

&gt;<i> (Async cancel is an oddity; there are, and should be, very few 
</I>&gt;<i> async-cancel-safe functions. Async-cancel regions of code cannot 
</I>&gt;<i> accomodate resource acquisition or release of any sort, as the recovery 
</I>&gt;<i> code is generally unable to determine the state of the resource.)
</I>
Yes. This is why I don't feel it's necessary to discuss it further since
so little code will be concerned with it, we can altogether not deal
with it for most C++ libraries.

&gt;<i> Nevertheless, it's quite reasonable to write a &quot;thread-safe&quot; special 
</I>&gt;<i> purpose application routine that doesn't deal with cancellation simply 
</I>&gt;<i> because the designer KNOWS that a thread running that code cannot be 
</I>&gt;<i> cancelled. One might even make this choice within in a general purpose 
</I>&gt;<i> library in some cases -- say, for a daemon thread that could never run 
</I>&gt;<i> application code nor be identified to the application, and that 
</I>&gt;<i> therefore cannot be cancelled.
</I>
Yes. Exactly. I have written a lot of code like that. The core C++
threaded code is hidden far away from the user which cannot therefore
&quot;posix-defer-cancel&quot; it. It can't even ever get the C++ exceptions since
they are catch (...) and transformed into C error codes.

As a conclusion to these (tentative) definitions, I believe the purpose
of this mailing list is to find a solution to develop &quot;defered-cancel
thread-safe&quot; C++ libraries: simple &quot;thread-safe&quot; libraries do not
require special attention. If everyone could agree to the statement
above, it would probably make the discussion more productive: other
threading models which do not support async cancelation are of no
interest to the discussion and can be forgotten.

If people agree on this statement, the only issue I can see which
delimits the design space for the solution to this problem is whether or
not you wish to allow the C++ library calling into C code (which uses
pthreads) and/or allow C code to use the C++ library (which uses our C++
threading solution).

Maybe it would help to consider the two cases separatly and try to
figure out what requirements each case creates:
	1) C++ library calls C++ code and is called by C++ code.
	2) C++ library calls into C code.
	3) C code calls C++ library.

The hard part seems to be 2) and 3) where, if you use exceptions to
propagate a cancel operation from either a cancelation point or a
pthread_exit call, you need to correctly handle the registered
cancelation handlers _and_ the C++ catch blocks in the right order. That
seems pretty hard (ie: impossible) to me, being just a _user_ of thread
libraries.

If people are not interested in 2) and 3) and just want to design a
solution for 1), then I think it will make the discussion more
productive to acknowledge it.
