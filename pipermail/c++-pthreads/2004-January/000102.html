</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I, at least, have no trouble with the idea of using C++ exceptions to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>report cancellation.  In fact, I think it's a great idea in general.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>It's just a really bad idea for functions which can normally be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>expected never to throw exceptions to start throwing cancellations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>when used in a POSIX threads environment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>IIUC, other &quot;C++ people&quot; who don't like the idea of printf throwing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>an exception feel the same way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although I wasn't counting you in particular as an objector, I may
</I>&gt;<i> have overgeneralized the objections of others. The whole matter of
</I>&gt;<i> interaction with throw specs in particular is complicated, and I
</I>&gt;<i> certainly don't claim to have any answers -- easy or otherwise. I've
</I>&gt;<i> considered making a couple of rambling conceptual statements, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> way out of my league here on C++ philosophy and history, and I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't want anyone to think I'm doing more than idle speculation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of those idle thoughts was that the concept of &quot;cancel state&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (enable or disable) might even be meaningless (or at least
</I>&gt;<i> irrelevant) for a pure C++ binding. This might simply be a dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> property of the current call tree; depending on the nested throw
</I>&gt;<i> specs. That is, if the cancel exception can be thrown cancel is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;enabled&quot;; and if it cannot then cancel is &quot;disabled&quot;.
</I>
What do you mean by &quot;can be&quot;, and what does it have to do with
exception-specifications?  Are you suggesting that cancellation is
disabled by writing an exception-specification that doesn't include
it?  Interesting thought, if so, but how do you disable just
cancellation without masking other exceptions?
