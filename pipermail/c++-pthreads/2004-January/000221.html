</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Again, I don't think it should be possible to have cancellation within a 
destructor unless the destructor &quot;does something special and unusual&quot;. 
In your example, you might want to make the release message cancellable, 
because the remote release might take a long time. Depends on the 
consequences of abandoning that particular remote resource, I suppose. 
If you did choose to make it cancellable, then, yes, you'd need to 
finalize the cancel within the destructor to avoid confusing propagation 
problems; which means that it needs to resurface later. This does tend 
to favor Jason's model. I remain vaguely uncomfortable with the notion 
of automatically re-pending the cancel at the right points, but I never 
intended to pretend to having any certain knowledge that there really 
are problems. ;-)
