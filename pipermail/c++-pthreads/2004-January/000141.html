<PRE>hi all,

It looks like what everyone is trying to achieve here is a way for C++
authors to write thread-safe libraries. The major problem which seems to
plague this discussion is that different people assume different
definitions for thread-safety. Here is my take. Hopefully, without too
many factual errors...

Definition &quot;thread safety&quot;
--------------------------
A thread-safe library is a library which uses locks to protect data
which can be potentially accessed from different threads. This kind of
code is typically written with a trivial small OS-abstraction layer
which implements basic semaphore semantics (or another synchronization
primitive). This kind of library was never written to deal with
&quot;cancelation&quot; (not the POSIX cancelation primitive but, more generally,
externally-triggered death of the thread) and is not safe with regard to
either &quot;inside&quot; or any form of &quot;outside&quot; cancelation as defined below.

Definition &quot;cancelation&quot;
------------------------
All OSes provide a mean to stop the execution flow of a thread either
from the inside of the thread or from the outside.

1) &quot;inside cancelation&quot;: This is basically ExitThread (win32 name). It
exists on all the platforms which support a form of threads or another I
know of. It semantics vary a lot from one platform to the other
unfortunatly. On win32, it will not invoke any thread-specific cleanup
handlers (neither C++ exceptions nor SEH are involved). On BeOS
(exit_thread), it will behave just like on windows. On POSIX
(pthread_exit) systems, it will invoke the thread-specific cancelation
handlers.

2) &quot;outside cancelation&quot;: There are two kinds of &quot;outside cancelation&quot;:

	2.1) &quot;async cancelation&quot;: The OS removes the thread from its list of
tasks to schedule and does nothing to cleanup the thread ressources.
This is the most extreme useless feature of a thread library. BeOS and
win32 provide it. POSIX does not provide it.

	2.2) &quot;defered cancelation&quot;: I know of only POSIX to implement this. The
canceled flag for the target thread is set and the thread cancelation
handlers are invoked whenever the thread reaches a cancelation point
(that is, it calls one of a set of specific library functions).

Definition &quot;Posix thread-safety&quot;:
---------------------------------
A library is &quot;posix thread-safe&quot; if it is thread-safe and
defered-cancelation-safe.


I hope the above definitions will help.

regards,
Mathieu
