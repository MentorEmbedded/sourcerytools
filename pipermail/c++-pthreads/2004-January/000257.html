</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Nathan's proposal does allow that (not that I really like Nathan's 
</I>&gt;<i>proposal). You'd simply have to manually disable cancelation. Think of 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;traditional&quot; pthread_cleanup_pop(!0) handlers.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Only if the code was specifically aware of cancellation and the 
consequences. But it seems that the primary basis for Nathan's proposal 
(and the only real justification I can see) was the idea that 'if 
(error) {cleanup(); return error;}' idiom in existing C code would 
continue to work despite cancellation. And that's simply not true; in 
general you'd need to re-code cleanup() to disable cancellation. (And at 
least all such would need to be analyzed carefully to ensure that 
cleanup() didn't call any cancellation points.)

&gt;&gt;<i>Jason's proposal will cause the cancel to be re-asserted when the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>exception object is destroyed, on exit from the catch(), after local
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>cleanup has been done. This makes the catch() behave (more or less) like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a destructor.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And that's &quot;the big&quot; weakness. catch() != destructor.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Unfortunately, there's apparently an extremely common (and perhaps even 
officially recommended) IDIOM in C++ that implements non-object-specific 
&quot;destructors&quot; using catch(...). It appears that there's general 
consensus here for a plan that retains this idiom, and I can understand 
that desire. While I don't really like the idea of &quot;sticky cancel&quot;, I 
don't yet see another practical alternative that addresses the basic 
problem without redesigning C++. (Of course, it's fine for you to bring 
this up, though I think you harp on it too much; if the C++ committee IS 
interested in considering a massive redesign of C++ exceptions, this 
would be a good time.)

&gt;<i>void operation() throw(std::thread_cancel_request);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>void f() {
</I>&gt;<i>  try {
</I>&gt;<i>    operation();
</I>&gt;<i>  } 
</I>&gt;<i>  catch(...) {
</I>&gt;<i>    pthread_exit(&quot;Wow, canceled.&quot;); // or something like that
</I>&gt;<i>  }
</I>&gt;<i>  /* ... */
</I>&gt;<i>}
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Given that pthread_exit() is also an exception, there's little 
difference between this and &quot;throw my_fancy_exception&quot;. (Aside from the 
fact that unlike my_fancy_exception, the thread exit exception is also 
designated as &quot;thread terminating&quot;.)
