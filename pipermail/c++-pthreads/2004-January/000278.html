Here's sort of solution:

  template&lt;class _FwdIt, class _Tval&gt; inline
  void _Uninit_fill(_FwdIt _First, _FwdIt _Last, const _Tval&amp; _Val,
          _Nonscalar_ptr_iterator_tag)
  {       // copy _Val throughout raw [_First, _Last), arbitrary type
    _FwdIt _Next = _First;
    try {
      for (; _First != _Last; ++_First)
        _Construct(&amp;*_First, _Val);
    }
    /* THIS DOESN'T CATCH *UNEXPECTED* EXCEPTIONS */
    /* THIS DOES RETHROW EXCEPTIONS AUTOMATICALLY */
    /* NOTHING ELSE CAN BE THROWN FROM THIS SCOPE */
    action_on_propagation_of(...) {  
      for (; _Next != _First; ++_Next)
        _Destroy(&amp;*_Next);
    }
  }

The idea is that if a destructor here attempts to exit with an
exception then std::unexpected() will be invoked at throw point. In a 
way, using hypothetical &quot;no_throw {}&quot; (in addition to hypothetical
&quot;action_on_propagation_of()&quot;) it is equivalent to

  template&lt;class _FwdIt, class _Tval&gt; inline
  void _Uninit_fill(_FwdIt _First, _FwdIt _Last, const _Tval&amp; _Val,
          _Nonscalar_ptr_iterator_tag)
  {       // copy _Val throughout raw [_First, _Last), arbitrary type
    _FwdIt _Next = _First;
    try {
      for (; _First != _Last; ++_First)
        _Construct(&amp;*_First, _Val);
    }
    /* THIS DOESN'T CATCH *UNEXPECTED* EXCEPTIONS */
    /* THIS DOES RETHROW EXCEPTIONS AUTOMATICALLY */
    /* NOTHING ELSE CAN BE THROWN FROM THIS SCOPE */
    action_on_propagation_of(...) {  
      no_throw {
        for (; _Next != _First; ++_Next)
          _Destroy(&amp;*_Next);
      }
    }
  }

presuming 2-phase (and a bit &quot;extended&quot;) EH, of course.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a somewhat persuasive case for disabling cancel during all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; destructors, but I'm not sure it outweighs the overhead involved.  In the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; model I proposed, only the EH runtime needs to know about cancellation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I tried to say before, my main objection to your model is that,
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the thread's dynamic context, destructors will behave
</I>&gt;<i> differently when hitting a cancellation point.  Sometimes, your model
</I>&gt;<i> will protect us from cancellation exceptions, but at other times it
</I>&gt;<i> won't, and I fear the confusion that might result from this.
</I>
Not that I really like Jason's model, but &quot;confusion&quot; does already 
exist in POSIX; I mean pthread_cleanup_pop(!0) &quot;destructors&quot;.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that the overhead of disabling cancellation in all destructors
</I>&gt;<i> could become a problem.  
</I>
That's good.

&gt;<i>                         IMO, if we have sticky cancellation, the EH
</I>&gt;<i> runtime doesn't need to be disable cancellation either.
</I>
But it has really nothing to do with stickiness. 

[...]
&gt;<i> The thing that changes because of cancellation is that some functions
</I>&gt;<i> that didn't throw before will now be licensed to do so.  It seems to me
</I>&gt;<i> that most of the participants on this mailing list accept that this will
</I>&gt;<i> require changes to existing code.  That could include adding a try/catch
</I>&gt;<i> block to destructor code.
</I>
If C++ would impose implicit (&quot;by default&quot;) throw() specs on all 
destructors AND adopt 2-phase EH with &quot;intelligent&quot; cancel delivery, 
things like

object::~object() {
  fclose(/*...*/);
}

won't need any changes... and it won't impose any runtime overhead 
(on any modern PC-mapped EH impl) as long as you &quot;run across&quot; 
cancellation points disabled via throw specs WITHOUT pending cancel 
request.

alexander.
