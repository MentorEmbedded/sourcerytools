<PRE>&gt;<i> ... the problem isn't with the model, but rather with the effect of that 
</I>&gt;<i> model on existing code that all-too-casually and agressively eats 
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions it doesn't understand. I think there are vanishingly few 
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances where a blind catch(...) without an unconditional re-throw 
</I>&gt;<i> should be considered &quot;legitimate&quot;. If you don't completely understand 
</I>&gt;<i> what an exception means, you cannot claim to have completely recovered, 
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore cannot reasonably finalize propagation. (And when you 
</I>&gt;<i> catch anonymously, you can't possibly understand what they mean since 
</I>&gt;<i> you can't even identify them.) On the other hand, regardless of whether 
</I>&gt;<i> the semantics are meaningful or reasonable, the syntax is legal and 
</I>&gt;<i> apparently (unfortunately) in common use, so I can't dispute that you 
</I>&gt;<i> need to consider that.
</I>
This problem could be eliminated by specifying that cancellation
is a special case, that cannot be caught by catch(...), i.e., that
it can only be caught by a handler that names it explicitly, or that
it cannot be caught at all.
