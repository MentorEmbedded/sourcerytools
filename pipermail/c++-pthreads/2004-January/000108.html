This is not correct.  The IA-64 ABI describes &quot;forced unwinding&quot;
but does not describe its semantics at all.  Which is of course
completely unhelpful.

My initial implementation of forced unwinding skipped catch-all,
and ran destructors.  This was vetoed by G++ folks.

The current implementation of forced unwinding is to treat it
just like any other kind of exception.  Almost useless, IMO,
since there's now a high likelyhood that longjmp_unwind will
not arrive at its intended destination.

The current protection against swallowing thread cancellation
(and longjmp_unwind) is done by having the destructor for the
exception object call abort.

&gt;<i> ... we should probably do is abandon the notion of forced unwinding
</I>&gt;<i> and make cancellation into an ordinary exception.
</I>
We already have, modulo the fact that the current implementation
has no typename.
