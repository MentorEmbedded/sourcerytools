</I>Ah. I see the problem. I believe that you neglected to file in 
triplicate the official &quot;List of all matters with which I disagree so 
please don't shout when discussing them&quot; form. Didn't you? ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i>The code must be analyzed and corrected, point by point; and the

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Well, it should be no surprise that this discussion has fragmented into 
too many different little pathways for anyone to keep track of them.

If cancel is implemented completely as a &quot;full stature&quot; C++ exception, 
and none of the &quot;exception safe&quot; code does anything silly like 
&quot;catch(...)&quot; without a re-throw, then, yes, it's likely to be reasonably 
cancel-safe. (Though some code might need to be aware that an uncaught 
cancel will terminate the thread rather than the process!)

But I was really responding to the ideas about turning cancel into a 
return status, which seemed to be associated with the notion that this 
would somehow make it more transparent to the ported code. (I happen to 
think the OPPOSITE is true. Am I allowed to shout there? ;-) ) This may 
also be associated with some implications of a statement about porting 
&quot;pthread code&quot; into the new C++ environment; and since &quot;pthread&quot; code is 
by definition C rather than C++ (no C++ in POSIX!), it cannot be made 
portably exception safe. (Of course the same C extensions on Tru64 and 
OpenVMS that allow handling of cancel allow cleanup on propagation of 
any other exception; but that's an extension.)
