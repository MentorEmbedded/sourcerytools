One legitimate use for that pattern is in mixed-language programming, 
when you write a little adapter to turn the error reporting mechanism 
used by the C++ part into an error reporting mechanism that the C part 
can understand. I think that's reasonable for most of the things 
exceptions are used for.  It isn't reasonable for thread cancellation, 
because C needs to know about thread cancellation too.  (Maybe this 
means that thread cancellation isn't quite &quot;error reporting&quot;.)

It looks to me like most of the recent discussion has come back to 
catch(...).  I wonder if that's really the fundamental problem we have 
to solve?
