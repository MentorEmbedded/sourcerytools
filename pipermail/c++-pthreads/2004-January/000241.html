Thank you for summing up.

I believe that I would support all elements of your proposal, with the
possible exception of:

&gt;<i> My preference is still to amend the C++ standard to allow stdio functions
</I>&gt;<i> to throw cancellation.
</I>
However, I don't see that as a particularly big deal one way or the
other.  The observation has already been made that the goal of
preserving existing C++ code is probably incompatible with introducing
cancellation, although Nathan's ETHREADCANCELLED idea is designed to get
around that.

&gt;<i>  * Should cancellation also be disabled in destructors run during normal
</I>&gt;<i>    execution?  In catch blocks?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, no and no.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i>  * How can C++ code interact with a cancellation exception?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think everyone agrees that it should be possible to catch a cancel by
</I>&gt;<i> name.  We still need to specify that name and any additional operations the
</I>&gt;<i> cancel object might support.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i>  * What about pthread_exit?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy with the g++ status quo whereby destroying a pthread_exit
</I>&gt;<i> exception calls terminate.  Unlike cancellation, the position of a call to
</I>&gt;<i> pthread_exit is deterministic, so the user is responsible for making sure
</I>&gt;<i> that it can propagate.
</I>
I have no strong feeling here, but calling &quot;abort&quot; would be fine by me.
