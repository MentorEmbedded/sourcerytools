</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Even if only *some* of it does that, Nathan and Jason's models are

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I need to start keeping a scorecard. Lessee here, Nathan's model I 
believe could be trivially characterized as &quot;return failure status on 
any cancellation point until you hit a C++ function allowed to throw&quot;. 
This would apparently disable any cleanup operations involving 
cancellation points (they'd fail) at least prior to the first throw 
point -- and it's not precisely clear how the &quot;pending cancel&quot; state is 
to be managed even beyond that point. While it might eventually lead to 
cancellation, it won't reliably perform cleanup. This seems to me to be 
more complicated, less predictable, less compatible, and less reliable 
than simply using exceptions integrated with the existing POSIX cleanup 
mechanism.

Jason's model, putting together the puzzle pieces from various messages 
here, appears to be basing cancel on an ordinary (&quot;finalizable&quot;) C++ 
exception, which would be raised by any and all cancellation points; but 
if the exception object were to be destroyed (by finalization), the 
&quot;pending cancel&quot; would (might?) be reasserted. I personally feel that it 
ought to be reasonable to finalize the cancel and continue operation. If 
that wasn't really what the application intended then it's an 
application error; but there are cases where it's arguably reasonable, 
and the capability falls naturally out of the model. Besides, 
&quot;reasserting cancel&quot; in all the right places and no other places sounds 
like one of those projects that ends up being a lot more subtle and 
error-prone than anyone ever expects. ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i>(Though some code might need to be aware that an uncaught cancel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>will terminate the thread rather than the process!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Remember, we're talking about library code.  Usually it's only used
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;on the inside&quot; of threads so it doesn't care whether when it's
</I>&gt;<i>terminated, it's the process or only a thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But I was really responding to the ideas about turning cancel into a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>return status
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>...only for 'C' functions which ordinarily have a return status and don't
</I>&gt;<i>throw...  did you miss that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It doesn't matter. There are many problems lurking here, and only one of 
the more obvious is that this attempt to avoid breaking C code that 
depends on 'if (error) {cleanup(); return error;}' will still break if 
'cleanup()' depends on any cancellation points... which in fact is quite 
likely if 'error' originates from a cancellation point (e.g., I/O). I 
also don't believe that a sufficient body of library code really follows 
the simple and direct 'if (error) return error;' pattern to make this 
strategy particularly useful even without the cleanup issues -- but 
that's a different matter. (It might actually be better if the pending 
cancel wasn't &quot;sticky&quot;, since then the cleanup at least might succeed; 
but then you'll lose cancels all over the place, and that's definitely 
not acceptable. It's fine for a thread to CHOOSE not to accept a cancel, 
either by keeping cancellation disabled or by not calling a cancellation 
point; but it's not OK to lose a delivered cancel. You can declare this 
to be the application/library developer's job rather than the 
implementation's job -- but that just means all this &quot;broken&quot; C code 
that fails to propagate errors needs to be redesigned; and you haven't 
solved any real problem. That's the basic point: it needs to be analyzed 
and likely redesigned to be cancel-safe. You simply can't avoid that 
requirement.)

A) You cannot transparently make non cancel-safe C code cancel-safe, no 
matter how you try.
B) Delivering cancellation as a C++ exception will make much (though not 
all) exception-safe C++ &quot;translucently&quot; cancel-safe.
C) POSIX C cancel-safe code is already cancel-safe, but for an 
application containing mixed call stacks to remain cancel-safe, POSIX 
cleanup and C++ exceptions must be integrated into a single unwind; 
i.e., (by whatever name) basing both on a common exception library.
D) There are no useful or interestingly large bodies of rigorously 
&quot;cancel-safe&quot; C code that are not POSIX cancel-safe.

In other words, cancel-as-exception, and pthread_cleanup_push as a 
C-based &quot;try&quot; extension, gives you all the cancel-safety you can 
reasonably expect without recoding (and likely redesign). That's all 
that's needed. No less will suffice, and any more is needless 
complication. Non cancel-safe code will continue to work just fine as 
long as it's NOT cancelled -- which ought to be no terrible restriction 
since it was clearly written in and for an environment where 
cancellation either did not exist or wasn't needed.
