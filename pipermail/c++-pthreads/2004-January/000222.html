</I>&gt;<i> If all cleanup is done via destructors (or pthread_cleanup_push,

</I>&gt;<i>

I consider that a bad model.  (1) It is inconsistent with current
POSIX/Unix threads standards and practice, and so unlikely to get
vendor buy-in. (2) It makes it too easy for an application to
lose/forget/ignore cancellation.  I'm assuming cancellation will
*only* be reported via an exception.

&gt;<i> often be performed directly, rather than via destructors.  Once some
</I>&gt;<i> code has called a cancellation point that fails with ECANCELLED, there is
</I>&gt;<i> no way for the implementation to tell whether any further code which is
</I>&gt;<i> executed is cleanup code or just a resumption of the thread's main loop.
</I>&gt;<i> For cleanup code, cancellation must be disabled, so that the cleanup
</I>&gt;<i> code can perform I/O to release resources.  But for any long-running
</I>&gt;<i> non-cleanup code, cancellation must be reenabled; otherwise, we would
</I>&gt;<i> be failing to provide the limited assurance that cancellation will not
</I>&gt;<i> be accidentally ignored, which stickiness of cancellation was intended
</I>&gt;<i> to ensure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the implementation can't tell, the code must be modified to
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly enable and/or disable cancellation at appropriate points.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nathan's model was intended to preserve existing code that propagated
</I>&gt;<i> error returns, and that did not expect functions like read() or printf()
</I>&gt;<i> to throw exceptions.  However, because of the problems described above,
</I>&gt;<i> such existing code would still need to be changed to make cleanup work
</I>&gt;<i> properly.  So I don't think Nathan's model achieves his intended aim.
</I>
Yes.
