</I>
About what I'd expected.

&gt;<i> The origin of this discussion was on the GCC mailing list, when people 
</I>&gt;<i> were trying to figure out how gcc, glibc, and libstdc++ should handle 
</I>&gt;<i> the intersection of C++ and pthreads.  People in that discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> realized that this was a discussion that extended beyond the GNU 
</I>&gt;<i> community and that a solution adopted by gcc/linux wouldn't be nearly 
</I>&gt;<i> as interesting as a solution that was generally recognized as right.
</I>
That's encouraging. I guess it also explains the group name, since 
&quot;gcc/linux&quot; would likely be focused on C++ and POSIX threads, regardless 
of any skew between that and the long term goals of the C++ committee. 
So... &quot;Ah&quot;.

&gt;<i> In the end, &quot;generally recognized as right&quot; probably means getting 
</I>&gt;<i> approval from the C++ committee and/or The Austin Group.  But that's 
</I>&gt;<i> for another day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My goals are (I believe) very similar to yours: figure out what the 
</I>&gt;<i> POSIX C binding should mean for C++.  This might mean something as 
</I>&gt;<i> ambitious as coming up with a separate C++ binding, or it might mean 
</I>&gt;<i> making some minor tweaks and clarifications in the existing C binding 
</I>&gt;<i> and/or the existing C++ language specification.  In principle I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> agnostic between the two.  In practice I suspect we don't have the 
</I>&gt;<i> resources or the vendor buy-in to do anything extremely ambitious.
</I>
I would like to think that it means a unique C++ binding, because this 
would present far too many unique and useful opportunities to ignore. 
However I also think there ought to be strong compatibility, at least 
&quot;philosophically&quot; with POSIX; especially in areas like cancellation 
where there's substantial POSIX existing practice and virtually no 
existing practice outside POSIX. And most especially considering that 
the kernel and C runtime will need to coexist with both models.

While some changes to the existing C language POSIX specification might 
be necessary, inevitable, or even desirable, the sort of fundamental 
change in cancellation model some have proposed here is a non-starter. 
C++ may be worried about trying to support non-POSIX threaded code 
(though I've expressed several doubts about precisely what that's 
supposed to mean and whether it's relevant), but keep in mind that such 
a fundamental change in the existing POSIX specification would break ALL 
(correct) existing general-purpose POSIX-based threaded libraries, and 
many existing applications. To say such a change would be &quot;contentious&quot; 
would be an absurd understatement. In fact, I would argue that for the 
Austin group to accept such a change would be truly irresponsible. And 
also that for any OS to continue to support POSIX threads while also 
supporting a radically distinct C++ threading model would be onerous and 
impractical. None of this need necessarily serve as a constraint on the 
C++ committee. But then, it doesn't hurt to think about things like 
&quot;vendor buy-in&quot;, and that's a lot easier when you're not making radical 
and contradictory requirements.

Of course that's a simplification, because some of the C++ rules and 
idiom around exceptions presents a different sort of contradiction with 
&quot;POSIX compatible&quot; model, and that's not trivial to resolve either. I 
don't mean to discount that, but obviously my focus is more on POSIX 
than on C++, and I can only contribute what I have to contribute.
