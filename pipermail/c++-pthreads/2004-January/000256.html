</I>Yes, I am; although I'm far more interested in having a common exception 
library with the capability available, than in necessarily modifying C++ 
to fully exploit it. In fact, as I've told you before, my arguments were 
entirely in regard to a hypothetical &quot;common exception library&quot; (such as 
the ones to which I'm accustomed on Tru64 and VMS), and I have no 
interest in involving myself in extending this discussion to C++. While 
I see advantages in 2-phase EH for C++, this is counterbalanced by the 
enormous pain that would be involved in trying to switch at this late 
date. Perhaps if we'd succeeded in convincing Bjarne Stroustrup to do it 
that way in the first place, things would be different. ;-)

In any case, though, we're talking about how to fit threads (and cancel) 
into C++. The subject here is NOT how or whether to radically 
re-engineer the C++ exception model, nor is that necessary to deal 
rationally and usefully with threads and cancellation. So I prefer not 
to get drawn into an argument about that in this forum. I've already 
discussed this issue with Dave Abrahams. I know his opinion and he knows 
mine; and I guess now you've made sure that everyone else knows mine. As 
far as I'm concerned, that's the end of it unless &quot;they&quot; want to extend 
this discussion to cover such matters. (And I'd be surprised if anyone did.)

I'm not entirely sure I understand what you mean here by '&quot;intelligent&quot; 
cancel request delivery&quot;. If we discussed it before I don't recall that 
phrase.
