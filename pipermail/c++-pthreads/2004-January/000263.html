</I>
Agreed. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Jason's proposal will cause the cancel to be re-asserted when the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;exception object is destroyed, on exit from the catch(), after local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;cleanup has been done. This makes the catch() behave (more or less) like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;a destructor.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;And that's &quot;the big&quot; weakness. catch() != destructor.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, there's apparently an extremely common (and perhaps even
</I>&gt;<i> officially recommended) IDIOM in C++ that implements non-object-specific
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;destructors&quot; using catch(...). It appears that there's general
</I>&gt;<i> consensus here for a plan that retains this idiom, and I can understand
</I>&gt;<i> that desire. 
</I>
That idiom is known as catch/re-throw. It does re-throw. Jason's 
sticky cancel is meant to &quot;address&quot; the problem of broken iostream 
stuff which doesn't re-throw.

alexander.
