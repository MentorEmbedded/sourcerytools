</I>
I think &quot;it&quot; in the last sentence quote above refers to Nathan's model,
not to the pending cancel state.

The problem is that cleanup -- e.g. execution of C++ destructors on
stack unwinding -- may involve calls to I/O routines that are themselves
cancellation points.  If these routines fail, then the cleanup functions
will not achieve their intended purpose; they will not be able to release
the resources that the thread holds.  Nathan's model implies that they
will fail.

&gt;<i> &gt; It doesn't matter. There are many problems lurking here, and only one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the more obvious is that this attempt to avoid breaking C code that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; depends on 'if (error) {cleanup(); return error;}' will still break if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'cleanup()' depends on any cancellation points... which in fact is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quite likely if 'error' originates from a cancellation point (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I/O). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In what sense will it break?
</I>
In this example, the function &quot;cleanup()&quot; may need to do I/O to
properly release the resources that the thread holds, but this
I/O will fail.

&gt;<i> &gt; (It might actually be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better if the pending cancel wasn't &quot;sticky&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You lost me.  What's &quot;sticky&quot;?
</I>
When a thread gets a cancellation request, the first
cancellation point encountered thereafter will act on that request
(by unwinding the stack, or in Nathan's model by returning an error
return status and setting errno = ECANCELLED).  If another
cancellation point is encountered after that, and there has not
been another cancellation request, then the cancellation point
will normally not have any effect.

With &quot;sticky&quot; cancels, after a cancellation request,
*every* subsequent cancellation point will act on the cancel
(by unwinding the stack, or failing with ECANCELLED).

&quot;stick&quot; cancels make it difficult/impossible to clean up properly,
since cleaning up may involve doing I/O, and in particular by calling
functions that Posix specifies are cancellation points.  These functions
will fail to do the I/O, because they will instead attempt to act on
the cancellation again (i.e. re-raising the cancellation exception
or failing with ECANCELLED).
