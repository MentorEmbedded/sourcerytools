Let me try again.

Doing a blind catch(...) without an unconditional rethrow is not always 
a matter of sloppiness.  Sometimes, the only alternative is a crash - 
the C++ standard clearly says that a second exception escaping from a 
destructor invoked by the stack unwinding machinery will result in 
program termination.  There is nothing the poor programmer can do about 
this.

To reiterate: a few days ago, I posted the following example -

   remote_resource_holder::~remote_resource_holder()
   {
     remote_resource-&gt;release();
   }

Now what do you suggest I should do when an exception (say, a networking 
error, but it might just as well be a cancellation request) is thrown 
from somewhere within remote_resource-&gt;release()?  The way I see it, 
either the original exception or the one that was just thrown at me will 
have to be finalized.
