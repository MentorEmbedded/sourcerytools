Won't it fail to cancel the threads if the output blocks, e.g. because
it is redirected to Unix pipe that fills up?

&gt;<i> Admittedly if a std::lib call took an inordinate

</I>
That risk of cancellations being ignored can be avoided by ensuring
that all the code that you call is strongly cancellation-safe.

The problem with your suggested approach is that unless the cancellation
framework is part of the standard library, in general it's not possible
for third parties to write strongly cancellation-safe code!
Writing strongly cancellation-safe code requires (a) being able to poll
for cancellation and (b) being able to do blocking I/O in a way that
will wake up when a cancellation request is received.
