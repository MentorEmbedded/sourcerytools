As Richard Henderson explained, this uncatchable forced unwinding
(for longjmp_unwind() and thread cancellation) was originally proposed
and for a brief period was implemented in GCC, but was then removed.
In the current GCC implementation, if I understand things correctly,
all exceptions are catchable via the C++ catch-elipsis construct &quot;catch
(...)&quot;.  The idea of uncatchable exceptions was dropped because it
conflicted with standard C++ semantics which say that any exception can
be caught.  Some existing C++ code uses this for cleanup handlers, e.g.

	acquire_resource()
	try {
		use_resource();
	} catch(...) {
		release_resource();
		throw;	/* rethrow the same exception */
	}
	release_resource();

and the people who argued that code like this was important
and should be preserved won out over the people who argued
that longjmp_unwind() and thread cancellation should be uncatchable.

&gt;<i> For example, with GNAT, the task abort exception is processed
</I>&gt;<i> exactly like other exceptions.  The difference is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> superficial in that tha parser does not allow handlers for abort
</I>&gt;<i> in user code.
</I>
If my understanding of GCC is correct, the current situation with GCC
is the same.

&gt;<i> From what I've read here, and my own experience, it seems this is
</I>&gt;<i> the right thing to do, provided:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The only way to handle this new cancellation exception is via a
</I>&gt;<i> new syntax.
</I>
Unfortunately that would conflict with standard C++ semantics, which
say that any exception can be caught and handled using the catch-elipsis
construct &quot;catch (...)&quot;.
