On one hand, what it is important here is what is of interest to users. 
The idea of checking return value for error codes might work in small,
but it does not work properly in larger systems/libraries. 

I do not believe we should be conducting this discussion by focusing
on specific individual and I can't see anything from RTH's previous
message leading to believe that he was meaning Uli.

On the other hand, the idea of having printf (or assimilated) work
differently depending on whether it is part of C or C++ program is a
good recipe for confusion and disaster.  We have something to learn
from past experience, messing with C functions.
