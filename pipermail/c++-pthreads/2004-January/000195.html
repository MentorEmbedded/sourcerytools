<PRE>&gt;<i> Instead, this example serves to show how dangerous it is to let 
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions escape from destructors.  Especially when we don't now which 
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions may be thrown from remote_resource-&gt;release(), about the only 
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable implementation of this destructor is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> remote_resource_holder::~remote_resource_holder()
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>   try {
</I>&gt;<i>     remote_resource-&gt;release();
</I>&gt;<i>   } catch (...) {
</I>&gt;<i>     // We may try to log what happened,
</I>&gt;<i>     // but can't let the exception escape!
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've noticed that some people on this list object to this design, but so 
</I>&gt;<i> far, I haven't seen an alternative.  In other words, I think we should 
</I>&gt;<i> be prepared for threads that discard cancellation exceptions - which is 
</I>&gt;<i> why Nathan's 'sticky cancellation' makes sense to me.

There is no real problem here. 

1) Yes, you want to be able to catch all *local* exceptions, and
not rethrow them, in destructors and cancellation cleanup routines.

If you disable cancellation during the execution of such routines
you will never have a cancellation exception that would be caught
by the &quot;catch&quot; of your destructor example above.

2) This does not mean you can't disable the *generation* of a (new)
cancellation exception during execution of such a destructor or
cleanup routine.

3) This does not mean you will lose an old cancellation exception,
if that is what caused you to execute the destructor or cleanup
routine.  On return from this routine, execution will continue
along the path that took you into this routine, i.e., the
processing of the old cancellation exception.

4) This does not mean you will lose a new cancellation exception, if
you were executing the destructor or cleanup routine for some other
reason. Whenever you next get to a point where cancellation is
enabled again, the cancellation processing will begin.

It does mean that you need to be able to keep track of nested
cancellation-disabled sections, so that you can disable
cancellation during the entire exception processing sequence, up
until you are in the &quot;catch&quot;, and you can *also* (nestedly)
disable cancellation during destructors.
