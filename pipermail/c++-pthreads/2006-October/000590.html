Yes.  For the reasons I stated, I don't think this is a provable thing; 
the ISO C++ standard doesn't contemplate threads, so it's hard to reason 
about them.  The multi-platform C++ ABI used by G++ (and many other 
compliers) does contemplate threads, but doesn't specifically address 
the particular case that you posted.

</I>
Yes.  It would certainly be nice if PTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT were uniformly 
zero, but on some hardware that's not feasible.

&gt;&gt;<i> There are other issues around thread-safe initialization of statics 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a constant initializers which are addressed by some C++ ABIs, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have the simpler case of a constant initializer.

</I>
void f() {
   static int i = g();
}

Here, you cannot do the initialization statically; it must be done the 
first time that f() is called.  So, the key question is whether the 
initialization is thread-safe.  Does the programmer have to change that 
initialization to be thread-safe, using locks in f()?  Or does the 
compiler take care of it?

The multi-platform C++ ABI defines library functions that compilers may 
use to ensure thread-safe initialization of local statics.  However, 
using these functions is optional.  So, some compilers do it, some 
don't, and some do it only in certain modes.
