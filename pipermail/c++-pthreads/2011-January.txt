Hi,

I'm trying to do some string manipulation, however I don't seem to be getting the response I expect.
To compare individual characters in one string to another, as follows:

int lettercode(char letter[], unsigned long dest)

{

int  len;

char compare[27];

strcpy(compare, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ");

len = strlen(letter);

uart_send_num(len);

uart_send_num(letter[0]); // the result of this comes up as "00/"

if(!(strcmp(&letter[0],'H'))) // I've even tried if(!(strcmp(letter[0],'H'))) and if(!(strcmp(letter[0],"H"))) and if(!(strcmp(letter[0],compare[7)))

{

uart_send('k');

}

...

int main(...)

{

...

char sentence[256];

char compare[27];

int sentence_len;

strcpy(sentence, "HELLO");

strcpy(compare, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ");

sentence_len = strlen(sentence);

lettercode(sentence,0x31000000);

...

}

Any advice?

Thanks!
