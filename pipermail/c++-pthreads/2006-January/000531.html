<PRE>I cannot claim to be wholly familiar with all the consequences
of this issue.  However, it seems by being able to identify the
cancellation exception versus all others, I at least have a 
chance to satisfy the needs of the cancellation process and yet
retain legacy behavior for all other exceptions.  

I do not claim this approach is ideal either, as it still places a
burden on all developers to insure they do not swallow the
cancellation exception in their catch(...) handlers.  All in
all that is still a error waiting to happen.  Yet I believe
it is an improvement over the current situation.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have recently been struggling with the conflicts outlined

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Handling.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a thread library that has been affected by this problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The easiest path available to me is to rely upon the previous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior by using: export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.19  until the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue is more formally resolved.   Before doing that, I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like to ask a question that may allow me an alternate solution.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My issue centers around having a catch(...) handler which does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not rethrow.   I get the now expected: FATAL: exception not rethrown
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                                        Aborted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Based on this error, it seems one must rethrow the cancellation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exception 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to allow it to complete.  Yet, I certainly do not want to 
</I>&gt;<i> rethrow all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exceptions as well.  At least for default behavior, this 
</I>&gt;<i> results in an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uncaught exception that Aborts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is the type of this cancellation exception known such that 
</I>&gt;<i> I can employ
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a specific handler for it and allow it alone to be rethrown?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This allows my catch(...) handler to remain in place, yet allows the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cancellation exception to complete as required.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
