<PRE>

I have recently been struggling with the conflicts outlined
in Bug #160638, regarding pthread_cancel and C++ Exception
Handling.  

I have a thread library that has been affected by this problem.
The easiest path available to me is to rely upon the previous
behavior by using: export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.19  until the
issue is more formally resolved.   Before doing that, I would
like to ask a question that may allow me an alternate solution.

My issue centers around having a catch(...) handler which does
not rethrow.   I get the now expected: FATAL: exception not rethrown
                                       Aborted

Based on this error, it seems one must rethrow the cancellation
exception 
to allow it to complete.  Yet, I certainly do not want to rethrow all
other
exceptions as well.  At least for default behavior, this results in an
uncaught exception that Aborts.


Is the type of this cancellation exception known such that I can employ
a specific handler for it and allow it alone to be rethrown?

This allows my catch(...) handler to remain in place, yet allows the
cancellation exception to complete as required.

Thanks,
Paul Bouche
