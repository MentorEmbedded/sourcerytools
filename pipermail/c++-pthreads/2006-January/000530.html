<PRE>I seem to recall seeing this problem discussed at length on this
list, without development of any consensus on the best way to
solve it.

From my own experience with the Ada multitasking standard,
I lean strongly toward the approach you suggest, i.e., treating
thread cancellation as a special case, that is always re-thrown.
