I think that is what I said.  It was thread-safe code until the 
semantics of calls it uses changed without changing the names.  
What was good code is now broken, in a POSIX C thread-cancellation 
environment.  

&gt;<i> Implementing cancellation by throwing an exception has no effect on
</I>&gt;<i> the thread-safety of this code.
</I>
In other words, because (under the C binding) this code has already 
been broken, throwing exceptions through it won't break it any further.

However, we're not talking about the C binding here.  This list is for 
discussion of a C++ binding, which need not be so procrustean as the
C binding.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Jason, do you not consider those libraries worth preserving?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, they're already broken.
</I>
You answered the question with reference to the C binding.

Defining a C++ binding is the purpose of this list.  With an 
appropriately-defined C++ binding, those libraries need not be broken 
*when linked as part of a C++ program*.  In other words, you, as a C++ 
implementer, have the power to choose whether to preserve or to break 
those C and C++ libraries, regardless of what has been decided for
the C binding.  (C++ coders would certainly choose to preserve them, 
but it seems that no C++ coders are in a position to do more than try 
to persuade you.)  

So, I ask the question again, but in reference to the C++ binding
that we are working on here.  What would breaking all those thousands
of existing libraries buy us?
