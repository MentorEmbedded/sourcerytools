My understanding is that if a particular cancellation point is disabled,
this does *not* mean that the cancellation is discarded.  It means that
it will be kept around until the next cancellation point.  (The thread 
will
never see the cancellation if it never calls a function that is a
cancellation points, but that's an inevitable consequence of
any synchronous cancellation scheme.)
