This list was started in hope getting guidance for the implementers of 
gcc/glibc in creating a synchronous thread-cancellation binding that is
sensible for C++.

We assume implementers have full control of the compiler and support 
libraries, including any underlying C and related (e.g. &quot;pthread&quot;)
libraries.  [Someday the notion of an &quot;underlying&quot; C library will be 
seen as quaint and primitive, but evidently not yet.]  The binding 
doesn't have to match POSIX's binding for C, although it shouldn't 
demand heroics from the C library.

The goal, as I understand it, is to elucidate a model that is simple 
to describe and document, and to code to, and that may be implemented 
quickly and cheaply without ambiguities or troublesome choices.
