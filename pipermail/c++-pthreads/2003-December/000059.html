The scenario I've been thinking of is:

 * The POSIX cancellation points can throw a cancellation exception.
 * C++ I/O functions can throw a cancellation exception.
 * C++ catch blocks work normally.
 * If a cancellation exception is destroyed, the cancellation request
   is re-entered, and acted on again at the next cancellation point.

This model doesn't work as well for pthread_exit or longjmp_unwind, since
they don't have predefined deferral semantics.  I'm somewhat inclined to
stay with calling terminate if we swallow an exit exception.

I just did some testing on Tru64: Evidently in their structured
exception handling model, finalizing a cancellation exception discards the
cancellation request, as Mark was suggesting; ditto for pthread_exit.  And,
interestingly, abort().  Testcase attached below.

The main problem with extending these semantics to C++ is the iostream code
which traps all exceptions.  I think this is a mistake in the design of
iostreams, but it seems likely to be a common mistake, and I feel strongly
that it shouldn't silently discard the cancellation request.  That would
almost certainly be an unintended side-effect.
