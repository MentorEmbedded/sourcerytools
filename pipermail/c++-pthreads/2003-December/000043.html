I hope this list was not setup in order to come up with GCC- or
GLIBC-centric solutions.  I think that was precisely the opposite, if
I understand Matt's original suggestion correctly.

    I wonder if this is the right forum for this discussion?

    I agree with you and Jason that the C++ and POSIX standards are
    incompatible.  I also agree that it's very important to reconcile
    them, and that it's an embarrassment that it's taken so long to
    do it.  Essentially, you're proposing a C++ binding to (a part of)
    POSIX.


    The reason I wonder whether this is the right forum: this is the
    gcc mailing list.  But we don't want a gcc C++ POSIX binding, we
    want to have the same C++ POSIX binding for all relevant compilers
    and operating systems.
