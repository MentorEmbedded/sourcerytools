In what sense was it ever thread-safe?  It was fine for non-threaded code,
but has always been broken in a POSIX threads environment.

Yes.

</I>
Currently, the C++ binding is the C binding, so your example is broken
under C++ as well.  And it would seem rather odd for the C++ binding to go
to great lengths to accommodate code which is broken under C, when C++
already provides a simple way to express cleanups.  C++ code doesn't need
to mess with pthread_cleanup_push; it can just use destructors.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Jason, do you not consider those libraries worth preserving?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, they're already broken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You answered the question with reference to the C binding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Defining a C++ binding is the purpose of this list.  With an

</I>&gt;<i> *when linked as part of a C++ program*.  In other words, you, as a C++

</I>
On the contrary, these libraries are broken.  You are proposing to un-break
them.
