Of course.  This list is meant to bring in people from outside the gcc 
list, but it's not POSIX.  If we invent a design, and implement and 
demonstrate it, it's a valuable example for all C++ implementers.  But 
if we tie ourselves in knots trying to accommodate every historical 
mistake and every overconstrained implementation, we we will make no 
progress and no contribution, and will waste everybody's time besides.  

It is essential that we stick to the basics: what is essential, and 
what can we really implement?  It has already been observed that the 
standards as conceived are incompatible.   We are have no choice but 
to do something different, and work to standardize that.  (Actually, 
we do have a choice: we can fail.  Ada has no POSIX cancellation 
binding.)

Do you have anything to say about the model that was proposed, or can 
you propose an alternative?
