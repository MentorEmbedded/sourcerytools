<PRE>Please forgive my last posting, which was done in haste.  I just
read it, and realized it is nonsense, so I'll answer my own
question.  In the event of thread cancellation the POSIX read()
function does *not* return, but instead enters a control path that
causes it to execute the stack of cancellation cleanup handlers,
and then exit the thread.  The only way you could have
incompatibility would be if the cleanup handlers were not
executed, or the thread did not exit. As others have pointed
out here, there are few existing C applications or libraries 
that make correct use of thread cancellation and cleanup handlers,
and fewer (none?) C++ ones that rely on this.
