That seems fair to me.

That seems fair too.

Here I don't agree.

Firstly, you should say &quot;a portable C++ library&quot;, not &quot;a correct C++
library&quot;, since some C/C++ implementations do support throwing C++
exceptions across C code, and I'm sure some correct but not portable C++
code takes advantage of this.

Secondly, and more importantly, I think that allowing this case is
important for language interoperability, not just for C/C++, but also
for interoperability between C++ and other languages (many of which are
implemented via compilation to C).

Posix thread cancellation is, in effect, a mechanism that provides a
limited form of exception handling for C.  It is natural for C implementations
to extend C with more general support for exception handling, both for its
own inherent usefulness and for ease of interoperability with other languages.
For example, both GNU C and Microsoft C have provided C language extensions
for exception handling, and there have been numerous C libraries that
provide support for exception handling -- see for example

	- Costello and Truta's &quot;cexcept&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://cexcept.sourceforge.net/">http://cexcept.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt;

	- Doug Gwyn's &quot;ex&quot; package, available from the cexpect site.

	- Ian Zimmerman's &quot;exc&quot; package, also available via the cexcept site.

	- David Hanson's &quot;except.h&quot;, in his book &quot;C Interfaces and
	  Implementations&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/cii/">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/cii/</A>&gt;

	- Bruce W. Bigby's &quot;GEF&quot;
	  &lt;<A HREF="http://home.rochester.rr.com/bigbyofrocny/GEF/GEF.html">http://home.rochester.rr.com/bigbyofrocny/GEF/GEF.html</A>&gt;

	- Schotland and Petersen's (unnamed?) exception handling library
	  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.on-time.com/index.html?page=ddj0011.htm">http://www.on-time.com/index.html?page=ddj0011.htm</A>&gt;,

	- Kaz Kylheku's &quot;KazLib&quot;

	- Symbian EPOC

	- MLib

	- my own &quot;CXCPT&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~fjh/CXCPT/">http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~fjh/CXCPT/</A>&gt;

There are probably lots more examples.

Given the likelihood of C being extended in this way with some form
of exception handling, it is desirable to make this exception handling
interoperate well with both Posix thread cancellation and C++ exceptions.
This in turn essentially requires that Posix thread cancellation and
C++ exceptions interoperate well with each other.  To my mind that
includes being able to propagate C++ exceptions through cancellation-safe
C code.

When talking about cancellation-safe C code, we should consider that
this may also include exception-safe C code that has been (or will be)
written using a C exception facility that is compatible with and/or
interoperates with Posix thread cancellation.  Currently
pthread_cleanup_push() and pthread_cleanup_pop() are the only
_standardized_ facility for enabling C code to clean up during
stack unwinding.  C exception handling extensions will need to
provide their own facilities for that.  But it seems like a bad idea to have
more than one underlying mechanism for such clean up code; even if
we may be stuck with several interfaces, having them all be implemented
using a single underlying mechanisms seems like the only reasonable way
to get the desired level of interoperability.
