Are any threading environments other than POSIX worthy of
consideration here?  If not, anything that's not thread-safe under
POSIX is, as you say, not thread-safe period.  

Otherwise, POSIX is breaking thread-safe code by introducing the
possibility of control flow (unwinding) that can't be anticipated
without knowledge of POSIX itself.  The real-world problems that
breakage introduces for plain C are somewhat minimized by the fact
that C code has to know something about how to register cleanups in
order to get any unanticipated control flow other than termination.
Still, unanticipated termination can leak important system resources
and cause other difficult-to-diagnose problems.  For C++, it's a much
more serious problem because the binding wants to run destructors, and
you don't need special knowledge of POSIX in order to write a
destructor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Implementing cancellation by throwing an exception has no effect on

</I>
Obviously that depends on how you define &quot;thread safe&quot;.  Don't you
think defining it in terms of the POSIX standard is, in this case at
least, a bit circular?  It's a great way to close off certain parts of
the discussion, but it doesn't seem to provide us with any power to
think about the problems.

</I>
You say that like it's a *good* thing ;-)

I'm being slightly facetious here, but having destructors run
automatically under thread-cancellation is a double-edged sword if the
code's author was unable to anticipate the possibility of an
exception.
