Right.

If the purpose was just to come up with an implementation for a
particular compiler/system as a proof of concept, that could have been
done in GCC/GLIBC inner circles without creating this list and
alerting the world about it.

</I>
I'm carefully listening to what other people (and inputs from non-GCC
tied ones are most welcome) to say/propose before legislating about
what is relevant or not, historical mistake or not, essential or not.
