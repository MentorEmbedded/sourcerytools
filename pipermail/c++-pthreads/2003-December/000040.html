<PRE>Our goal is to define a binding that is possible, practical, and simple.  
Therefore...

I believe that we can achieve our goal if we omit impossible
requirements.  Of the above, I see the following as showstoppers
that must be jettisoned immediately:

 	- not require changes to the C pthread library

  We assume we can adapt the libraries involved as needed, as long as
  our demands are simple to describe and implement.

	- never result in a thread cancellation request being ignored

  This is impossible on its face, as it ultimately depends on users' 
  coding practices.  A reasonable goal would be that simple good coding 
  practices are unlikely to cause cancellation requests to be ignored 
  indefinitely.

 	- make cancellation-safe C code also exception-safe, and 
 	  allow propagation of C++ exceptions through cancellation-safe
 	  C code

  While cancellation-safe C code might exist, in principle, we should 
  not contort our solution to try to accommodate it.  A correct C++ 
  library does not let exceptions escape to C code, so this case is 
  only of academic interest.  We can presume that any C code that is 
  cancellation-safe also handles normal error returns sensibly.

 	- not [ever] reduce performance of any existing code

  Threads necessarily impose inefficiencies.  We can have a goal to
  minimze those.

 	- probably some other goals that I've accidentally omitted/forgotten

  We can burn those bridges when we get to them.

Let's try not to get sidetracked.  The consequence of failure or
excessive delay is that C++, like Ada, will remain incompatible with
any form of thread cancellation.
