OK, I have read those.

Unlike you, I have no interest in maintaining compatibility for the
sake of existing thread-cancel-safe libraries.  I don't know of any, 
and doubt more than a few exist.  I do know, however, of thousands 
upon thousands of ordinary thread-safe libraries.  I don't believe 
that the goal of a &quot;thread-cancel-safe&quot; library (that must take special
pains to achieve it) is desirable, nor, in the case of a C library, 
possible in general.

Therefore, I'm interested in defining semantics for a C++ binding that
allows use of existing (well-written) libraries, that are only normally
thread-safe, in threads that might suffer cancellation .  I'm interested 
in comments on whether the  semantics I posted would work, and in any 
suggested improvements.  If the model works, and &quot;we&quot; implement it, it 
should be easy enough to get some standards body to ratify it.
