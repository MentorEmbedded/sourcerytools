&gt;&gt;<i> Additional?  I'm lost again.  There is no workable cross-thread throw

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm. So your thread_throw(), like pthread_cancel(), would simply
</I>&gt;<i> stash the exception object away somewhere for the target (victim?)
</I>&gt;<i> thread to throw synchronously at a later time? At the same defined

</I>
Same points.

&gt;<i> Subject to cancelability state, or at the next cancellation point no
</I>&gt;<i> matter what?
</I>
Subject to cancelability.  In C++ &quot;cancelability&quot; would indicate
whether cancellation points can throw (these asynchronously-initiated
exceptions).  I actually think the parenthesized part could be
removed, for all practical purposes.  There's usually little point in
preventing a function from throwing cancellation if it can throw
something else.

&gt;<i> Do we need to worry about &quot;cancel disabled but other exceptions
</I>&gt;<i> enabled&quot;, or vice versa... and will people expect to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> enable or disable individual exception types?
</I>
Naw, I don't think so.  Nobody has mentioned a use case.  If we find
it is suddenly in demand because of some unanticipated use case, that
sort of selective cancelability is pretty easy to add.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And if you're generalizing the unstoppable exception,     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Generalizing?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't quite see how it makes sense not to generalize the deferral,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and now cancel really is just a specific predefined exception that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can be thrown like any other exception.  That's not necessarily bad;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I just don't see how it's a compromise. (A compromise needs to make
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> BOTH sides equally unhappy, not just one side!)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The compromise I'm proposing makes it possible to generate an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unstoppable cancellation (bad for us) while making it ugly and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unnatural to do so (bad for &quot;the other side&quot;).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Ah; I think I misunderstood the semantics of your thread_throw(). From 
</I>&gt;<i> your introduction I took it as a mechanism for injecting any exception 
</I>&gt;<i> into another thread as &quot;unstoppable&quot;. Apparently what you intended was 
</I>&gt;<i> that it simply injects ANY exception, and if that happens to be a weird 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;unstoppable&quot; exception it works the same as it would from a normal 
</I>&gt;<i> throw within a single call stack.
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> OK, I get it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So fine, perhaps that is a viable compromise. I'm not &quot;morally
</I>&gt;<i> opposed&quot; to a generalized cross-thread exception. I'm not thrilled
</I>&gt;<i> about anyone injecting unstoppable exceptions into some &quot;innocent&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> call stack; but like cancellation it can only be done when you at
</I>&gt;<i> least know the thread ID of the call stack (meaning either you
</I>&gt;<i> created the thread or the facility that did made the ID available to
</I>&gt;<i> you in one way or another, though possibly just by making a call
</I>&gt;<i> into your facility). And if someone does it to some arbitrary and
</I>&gt;<i> unprepared thread it'll may behave just as badly as they
</I>&gt;<i> deserve. ;-)
</I>
Yes.  

I do have sympathy, incidentally, for the other side's desire to &quot;try
really hard&quot; to shut a thread down cleanly.  I just don't happen to
think unstoppable exceptions are a particularly effective tool for
that job.
