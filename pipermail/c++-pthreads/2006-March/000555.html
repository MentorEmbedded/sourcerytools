Aww, c'mon.  You're seriously telling me that one thread can set the
&quot;there's now an active cancellation flag&quot; for another thread, and the
other thread can read it with _NO_ synchronization?  That isn't how I
learned things work by reading your book!

&gt;<i> That is, by definition, the communication protocol is
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous. (Actually, in pure POSIX cancellation is IS possible
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;post&quot; a cancel request without synchronization, unless you need
</I>&gt;<i> to blast through a blocking operation. With a general cross-thread

</I>&gt;<i> far below the application level, and provides no useful synchronous
</I>&gt;<i> behavior for the application developer; which amounts to the same
</I>&gt;<i> thing as &quot;asynchronous&quot;.)
</I>
So now you're telling me that my mental model for what's required to
write this state in one thread and read it in another is all wrong,
and I should be thinking of it in some way that makes it
&quot;asynchronous&quot; despite the fact that it really is synchronous under
the covers?

This sound like you're just making it worse for &quot;thought models,&quot; not
better.

&gt;<i> Only the final step, entirely within the target thread, is fully 
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous with that thread at a level that's of any use to the 
</I>&gt;<i> application model. The target detects at a cancellation/exception point 
</I>&gt;<i> that the request currently exists (registered asynchronously at some 
</I>&gt;<i> previous time ;-) ), and SYNCHRONOUSLY throws the exception into its own 
</I>&gt;<i> call stack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, yeah; the exception is synchronous. Fine. But that's only the final, 
</I>&gt;<i> and least interesting, step in the protocol. Or perhaps that's just 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;least interesting&quot; to ME, because &quot;I'm a thread guy&quot;. ;-)
</I>
Yes, to you.  For the purposes of the big argument over how these
exceptions work, it's a completely irrelevant fact (if you can even
call it that, because the real facts of the matter have only become
blurrier as I read more of what you write).
