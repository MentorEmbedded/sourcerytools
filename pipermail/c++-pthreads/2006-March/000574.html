<PRE>Maybe two different meanings of &quot;back out&quot;?

a) back out = work your way out of the nest of active subprogram
   calls, doing appropriate cleanups

b) back out = stop the cancellation, i.e.,
   stop processing the cancellation, and let the thread resume
   normal execution

Doing (b) would mean not completing (a).
I think Ulrich and some others expect (a) will always complete,
and so would not like to allow (b).
