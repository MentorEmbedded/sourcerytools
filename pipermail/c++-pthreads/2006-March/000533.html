</I>&gt;<i> statement&quot;), and I can't tell what side of it he'd come down on:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Any code that is already exception-safe could be automatically
</I>&gt;<i>    cancel-safe depending on our definition of &quot;cancel-safe&quot; and the
</I>&gt;<i>    semantics we assign to cancellation exceptions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the definition of &quot;cancel-safe&quot; that allows the statement to be
</I>&gt;<i> true, cancellation is a request, and doesn't absolutely force
</I>&gt;<i> _anything_ to happen.  IIUC, that is the status quo anyway (nobody is
</I>&gt;<i> even forced to invoke a cancellation point).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cancellation exception semantics that allow the statement to be
</I>&gt;<i> true are that they act like any other exception, and are not
</I>&gt;<i> automatically rethrown at the end of catch blocks.  This is the
</I>&gt;<i> question primarily in dispute, IIUC.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>This has been THE most contentious issue in every C++/threads discussion 
I've encountered since the beginning of (pthread) time.

My preference has always been that cancellation is an exception. Period. 
In our initial CMA architecture, and in our exception mapping of 
cancellation/thread-exit onto C language exceptions in Tru64 UNIX and 
OpenVMS, it's possible and reasonable to finalize propagation of a 
cancel/exit exception. That was critical for DCE, for example, so that 
it could trap cancellation of an RPC server thread, bring the thread 
back into the server's work pool, and propagate the exception across the 
wire to the client.

To finalize a cancel/exit under almost any normal circumstance is simply 
an application error. There are many worse application errors, like 
infinite loops, that we can't legislate around anyway. Worrying too much 
that someone might finalize the exception unintentionally just seemed 
like wasted effort. However it's also important to keep in mind that my 
preferences were formed with POSIX cancellation and C language (or 
cross-language OS) exceptions. C++ adds a lot of exception semantics and 
patterns on top of that.

There have been plenty of people who argue that cancel &quot;can't&quot; be 
caught; and some of these arguments trace back to the ubiquity of 
catch(...), especially in constructors; and they have some legitimate 
concerns about common C++ language patterns that might pretty much 
prevent a cancel from ever doing what a cancel should do.

There likely is no perfect solution.
&gt;<i> IMO, it is worth making cancellation exceptions like any other in
</I>&gt;<i> order to make the statement true.  It's also worthwhile to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> complicating the mental model programmers must use to think about
</I>&gt;<i> exception handling, which, believe me, is hard enough even for many
</I>&gt;<i> developers of general purpose libraries to grasp (how long did it take
</I>&gt;<i> Dinkumware to make their STL exception-safe?)  Finally, and this may
</I>&gt;<i> be counterintuitive at first,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   making cancellation stoppable by catch(...) like everything else is
</I>&gt;<i>   sometimes **required** in order to ensure that cancellation
</I>&gt;<i>   propagates all the way through the stack and terminates a thread as
</I>&gt;<i>   expected without crashing the program.  So those who want
</I>&gt;<i>   cancellation to act more like an absolute guarantee of thread
</I>&gt;<i>   termination should support it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, I write a C++ library for interfacing with Python.
</I>&gt;<i> Python is written in portable 'C' with no special treatment of
</I>&gt;<i> cancellation exceptions or the kinds of cleanups POSIX uses to do the
</I>&gt;<i> same thing in 'C'.  If I let any sort of C/C++-level exception
</I>&gt;<i> propagate into Python, its expectations are violated and will most
</I>&gt;<i> likely crash.  It's very common to have a layer of Python sandwiched
</I>&gt;<i> between C++ calls on the stack.  I can get proper cancellation
</I>&gt;<i> semantics by stopping cancellation exceptions at the boundary and
</I>&gt;<i> translating them into Python exceptions.  They'll propagate through
</I>&gt;<i> Python, and reach an exception translator on the other side that turns
</I>&gt;<i> them back into C++ exceptions.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>The catch lies in whether (and how far) you'll trust application 
developers to do the re-throw properly. If we don't clean up all frames 
and eventually re-throw the cancel/exit to the runtime's base frame to 
terminate the thread, then we don't have cancellation. On the other 
hand, if we prevent a catch or force a re-throw, we lose a lot of C++ 
(particularly in constructors).

Part of the reason that you &quot;can't tell what side of it [I'd] come down 
on&quot; is that I've long recognized this as an essentially religious rather 
than technical argument. You'll come down on the side of the semantics 
toward which you feel the strongest emotional attachment. While I'm 
happy to express my experience and even preferences, I also recognize 
that &quot;the other side&quot; has some equally strong arguments and 
expectations, and they (well, most of them!) are not &quot;wrong&quot;.

Someone needs to propose and champion &quot;the great exception compromise&quot;; 
but if that's to be me I don't yet have the faintest germ of a notion 
what it might be. So I sure hope it's going to be someone else. ;-)
