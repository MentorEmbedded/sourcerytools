Yes.  This is the choice that Ada made for handling task cancellation; 
it functions like an exception except that it cannot be caught, at least 
not by user code.

 &gt; However, again, if I recall correctly,
&gt;<i> Jason was also OK with the idea that a thread could catch a cancellation

</I>&gt;<i> to be re-canceled.
</I>
Yes.  Cancellation is not just an indication of a problem like most 
exceptions, it's specifically an attempt to unwind everything.  There is 
a lot of code out there that does catch (...), tries to do generic 
recovery, and continue.  iostreams does catch (...) and sets a flag 
instead of propagating an exception.  Neither of these situations should 
cause the cancel to be discarded.

Both the Ada approach and the re-cancellation approach avoid this 
problem of accidentally losing the cancellation request.

If you can interrupt cancellation, re-cancellation is implemented 
trivially simply by just having the cancellation exception destructor 
call 'pthread_cancel (pthread_self ())'.  The sticking point is being 
able to abort the cancellation in the first place, which is what Uli has 
been opposed to.

&gt;<i> As far as I remember, Ulrich is the only person who has really argued
</I>&gt;<i> that it is unambiguously wrong to consider the situation in which a
</I>&gt;<i> thread catches a cancellation exception.
</I>
I don't think he's opposed to catching it, just to doing anything that 
would involve backing out of the cancellation once it's started.
