IIRC, Jason Merill has also historically been sympathetic to the forced
exception mechanism, because (if I paraphrase correctly!) he feels that
it might help some code move into a threaded environment without change.
 In particular, by ignoring &quot;catch&quot; handlers, some subset of real
programs might behave well enough, in that destructors would run to
clean things up, and the code wouldn't have to be modified to know about
thread-cancellation exceptions.  However, again, if I recall correctly,
Jason was also OK with the idea that a thread could catch a cancellation
exception, but that future calls to cancellation points would cause it
to be re-canceled.

I might have just stuck an entire giant paragraph of words into Jason's
mouth, though, in which case I very humbly apologize.

As far as I remember, Ulrich is the only person who has really argued
that it is unambiguously wrong to consider the situation in which a
thread catches a cancellation exception.
