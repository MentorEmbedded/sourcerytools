The inability to do that would prevent several systems that Dave
B. and I have cited from working properly.  These systems, if allowed
to &quot;back out&quot; from a language/library point-of-view, will unwind
completely and terminate the thread as though there was no logical
&quot;backing out,&quot; but otherwise will exhibit undefined behavior.  So I
don't think preventing &quot;backing out&quot; at any level that can be enforced
by the language or library is tenable if you actually want
cancellation to be able to cancel threads.
