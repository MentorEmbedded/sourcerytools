This would be illegal according to the C API, since once a thread
begins executing cancellation handlers it becomes (irrevocably)
not cancellable.  That means a subsequent call to tthread_cancel
is required to have no effect on the thread.

So, if you want to do this you need a new function that is like
pthread_cancel but has special semantics.  That is, the developer
of the C++ binding would need to coordinate with the implementor
of pthread_cancel to provide this function not in the POSIX C API.

&gt;<i> ...  So, it seems like this ought to satisfy everyone

</I>
I've been talking about the implementor-perspective.  A standard will not
be much good unless you can also persuade the implementors to buy in .
