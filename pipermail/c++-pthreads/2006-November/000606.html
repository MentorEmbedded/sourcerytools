</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This section is a placeholder. The next C++ standard is intended to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide support for synchronization facilities and thread launching

&gt;<i> Sure; but it's not so clear that's &quot;a difference&quot; since many people
</I>&gt;<i> had a similar intent back then. In fact the first post to THIS
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list was nearly 3 years ago, and various other mailing lists
</I>&gt;<i> related to the subject of C++ and threads, and especially to
</I>&gt;<i> standardization thereof, have come and gone -- and generally stayed
</I>&gt;<i> pretty quiet.
</I>
This time we have a deadline to meet. My current understanding is that the 
placeholder section above has already been voted into the working paper by 
an official ISO formal motion, and the intent of the committee is that in 
'C++0X', X should be decimal. :-) In practice this means that the threading 
API proposal is already late by one meeting.
