The difference this time around is that some of us are trying to write a 
formal proposal for the planned

&quot;30 - Threading API
This section is a placeholder. The next C++ standard is intended to include 
support for a threading API. This feature is intended to provide support for 
synchronization facilities and thread launching and joining. For more 
information and snapshots of current draft proposals still under discussion 
and development, see: N1907, N2090.&quot;

section of the next C++ standard.

The frustrating part is that C++ folks say &quot;we need buy-in from vendors&quot; and 
vendors say nothing, apparently just waiting to see what the C++ standard 
will say. :-)

&gt;&gt;<i>    std::thread_termination_request (base for cancel and exit)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    std::thread_cancel_exception
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    std::thread_exit_exception&lt;T&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    std::thread_longjmp_exception
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, absolutely; the parenthesized bit being the most important
</I>&gt;<i> part... a common base class for cancel and exit.
</I>
I've absolutely no problem with that (from a C++ perspective), as long as 
it's implementable. There isn't much point in demanding something in the C++ 
standard that will be universally ignored.
