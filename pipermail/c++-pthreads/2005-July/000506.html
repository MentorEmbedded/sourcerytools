The problem is not to convince you.  The problem is to convince the 
otherwise-correct C++ code to behave like it used to.

I'd say it's time to face the truth, which is that POSIX cancellation 
semantics are incompatible with commonly established C++ coding 
practices.  As you may have noticed, my preferred solution is to 
selectively apply POSIX cancellation to small regions of code 
specifically written with cancellation in mind.

I doubt that :-).

&gt;<i> If so, please forge on ahead without me!
</I>
That doesn't sound like a good idea at all.
