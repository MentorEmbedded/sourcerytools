That's a big &quot;if.&quot;  You can't lump all flag-polling schemes into the
&quot;asynchronous&quot; bucket just because some do fall there.  I'm asking you
to be precise and make the distinction, because whether flag-polling
will be effectively asynchronous for some classes of C++ programs is
one of the points we're trying to decide.
