A real problem with the straightforward approach (2) is that cancellation 
requests can be lost. The thread that invokes pthread_cancel has no idea 
that the receiving thread has encountered an exception-eating catch block, 
so it doesn't know that it needs to retry the pthread_cancel call.

This problem has motivated several (proposed or real) drastic modifications 
of (2), including banning catch without rethrow via std::terminate, not 
invoking catch(...) blocks at all, or banning catch without rethrow in a 
coding standard and loudly condemning its use in public forums. In my 
opinion, it is much easier and cleaner to just address the actual problem 
instead - deprecating or crippling catch(...) is not within the charter of 
the group. :-) In other words, we need to make sure that cancellation 
requests aren't lost easily.

One additional detail is that under the POSIX rules, cancelability is 
disabled just before &quot;stack unwinding&quot; starts. Not a problem under pure 
POSIX C, because cancellation is impossible to finalize.

A problem under both (1) or (2), though. Even under (1), where cancellation 
is sticky and the request isn't lost, encountering a cancellation point will 
not re-raise a cancellation exception, because cancelability is left 
disabled.

Therefore, a useful model will at least have the following properties:

A. cancellation is sticky, requests aren't lost easily;

B. cancelability is not left disabled after a cancellation exception has 
been finalized.

A simple solution is to adopt (1) and re-enable cancellation at the end of 
the catch clause.

This solution is not without its merits and is actually a workable 
approximation of the &quot;ideal&quot; model, but it has the following problem: the 
proper value of the cancelability state after the exception is finalized may 
be &quot;disabled&quot;. In the example below:

// #1

try
{
    f();
}
catch( ... )
{
}

// #2

the cancelability state at #2 ought to be the same as the cancelability 
state at #1, provided that its only explicit manipulation is via a RAII 
guards that always restore it to its previous value.

Remembering the state at the cancellation point doesn't work; it may've been 
asynchronous. It may even have been disabled if the cancellation exception 
originated from an explicit user throw.

All this leads me to propose the following model:

C. the cancelability state only changes if pthread_setcancelstate is invoked 
(deviation from POSIX which resets it at the throw point to 
deferred+disabled);

D. to match POSIX semantics, cancellation points don't throw if there is an 
unfinished exception.

(D) makes no distinction between cancellation exceptions and other 
exceptions for the following reasons:

- every special case introduced into the core language will create more 
problems than it solves;

- the point of cancellation is to initiate stack unwinding, and when an 
exception is active, stack unwinding is already under way;

and

- given std::unfinished_exception(), the semantics of cancellation are also 
implementable in user code or libraries and do not need compiler support.

The last remaining issue is that (2) has one advantage over (1) - it enables 
the user to ignore a cancellation request. There are use cases that can take 
advantage of that - if you are interested I can go into more detail.

But under the model described so far, a cancellation request is a bit too 
sticky; it's impossible to ignore.

To address this, I propose that we provide an explicit API to clear a 
pending cancellation request... or at least specify it in case someone wants 
to revise his opinion on the irreversibility of cancellation. ;-)
