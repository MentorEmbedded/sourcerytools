I suppose you're after exit(main()) in initial thread and 
pthread_exit(start_routine(arg)) in other threads. What makes you 
think that library_call isn't start_routine (aka conventional
&quot;thread-main&quot; in your thread programming neighborhood), or its
equivalent apart from &quot;activation records&quot;?

</I>&gt;<i> If *I* didn't want the thread cancelled, I would simply choose not to

</I>
Same question. If you never cancel a thread, it's all moot. My 
question was about control of cancellation in a thread that can 
be a target of pthread_cancel().
