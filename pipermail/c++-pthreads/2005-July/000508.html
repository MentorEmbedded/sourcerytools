</I>Indeed. The only real (and unfortunately the hardest) questions are how 
to reconcile the (apparent) contradictions between cancel scope and C++ 
throw specs (explicit or implicit as in destructors), and cultural 
investment in catch(...).

Perhaps integration would be simplified if threads created using native 
C++ mechanisms (rather than the C pthread_create) started with 
cancellation disabled, allowing C++ programs to enable where desired. 
Then again, though, it's important to keep in mind that a thread is not 
subject to cancellation unless some thread with access to the thread ID 
CHOOSES to cancel it; nobody can force cancellation on a thread without 
its ID, and thread IDs are not generally available. And while any 
routine can cancel the current thread (pthread_self), doing this without 
certain knowledge that the thread's call stack can handle it is a pretty 
stupid programming error.

Cancellation is not like 'kill &lt;pid&gt;', forced arbitrarily from outside 
forces unknown; it's a COOPERATIVE request from friendly code. Only code 
running inside the thread, or code that closely collaborates with the 
creation or management of the thread (by prior agreement) can ever 
cancel a thread.

And the C++ committee could define C++ threading without cancellation; I 
think that would be a mistake in the real world, and I know many others 
will, but the committee need not care. However, if C++ has cancellation 
it has to be cleanly integrated with C/POSIX cancel and cleanup, and the 
only viable language/implementation model is to make cancel an exception.
