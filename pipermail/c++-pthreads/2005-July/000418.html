Even when cancelled?

I don't see how this is going to work.

Consider a pure C program that calls a cancellation point, 'fwrite' for 
instance. fwrite &quot;throws&quot; - unwinds the stack and calls Posix cleanup 
handlers.

Now consider a pure C++ program that calls that same 'fwrite'. It doesn't 
throw, it signals failure.

But what does fwrite do in a mixed C/C++ program? &quot;Throw&quot; when called from C 
code and return failure when called from the C++ part? What if a C function 
calls fwrite and is itself called by C++ code? No matter what fwrite does, 
it will break the C part or the C++ part, or maybe both.
