That's as wrong as saying that exceptions magically solve all your
error handling problems.

&gt;<i> The idea of thread cancellation is very simple and very appealing,

</I>&gt;<i> I've seen this among students in the courses where I teach
</I>&gt;<i> programming with threads (using C).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Such naive programmers will write a program using threads, and
</I>&gt;<i> then try to shut a thread or threads down by just cancelling them.
</I>&gt;<i> They do not fully understand the ramifications of the thread
</I>&gt;<i> cancellation model, use whatever libraries are at hand, and do not
</I>&gt;<i> design from the beginning with cancellation in mind.  As a result,
</I>&gt;<i> they run into trouble, such as lockups due to cancellation or
</I>&gt;<i> threads that are holding mutexes on which another thread is
</I>&gt;<i> depending for a pthread_cond_signal to wake up.
</I>
All of that is totally independent of exception-handling.
