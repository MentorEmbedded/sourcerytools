Thread robustness code like the following:

while (true)
 try
  {
   body();
  }
 catch (...)
  {
   recover();
  }

Under the old non-EH implementation this thread cancelled properly.  Under
#1 it doesn't; it goes into an infinite loop of throw/recover.

Sure, a thread can disable cancellation.  I consider that &quot;taking
arbitrarily long,&quot; because if it ever enables it again the request is still
there and will be acted on.

Furthermore, if you find that your cancel isn't being processed, it's easy
enough to grep for pthread_setcancelstate.  Finding the random code written
to deal with program-generated exceptions which is now interfering with
cancellation is not as simple.

Incidentally, my list of uses of catch(...) omitted the use in iostreams,
which is much like the inter-language glue case, except that it's just glue
to another error reporting mechanism.  As in that case, #1 handles the
iostream use by re-asserting cancel later on.  #2 handles it by just
continuing to run cleanups if the function is allowed to throw, or by
disabling cancellation within the function if it isn't allowed to throw.
#3 blows up.
