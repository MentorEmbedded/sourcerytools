It's trivially possible, and it's hardly magic.  All it needs is to 
accept that what POSIX attendees decided for C based on essentially 
no understanding of exceptions, is not the only way to do things.  

However, the only (other) people still posting here appear to be 
those who long since gave up on making thread cancelling work in 
real-world programs.  Whatever you guys come up with, if anything,
will affect perhaps a few dozen people in all the world.  Vendors, 
mostly.

The rest of us will return to understanding that thread cancellation 
doesn't and won't work usably in real programs, and forget about it
-- just as practically everybody coding C did long ago.  Given that, 
the best you can do here is to specify something truly trivial to 
implement (even for vendors who haven't implemented C cancellation), 
so that vendors can mark their checkboxes, and then forget about 
it too.
