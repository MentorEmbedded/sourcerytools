I do think it's possible to argue for an exception-less mode, following 
the old GNU/Linux practice of just running pthread_cleanup_push'd code. 
  It is reasonable, though perhaps not entirely desirable, to just say 
&quot;On its face, POSIX says X, so we did X, and no more.&quot;

But, what doesn't seem reasonable is skipping &quot;catch (...)&quot;.

I'm having a hard time overcoming the fact that all of Nathan, David, 
myself, and you -- before your conversion to plan #2 -- seemed to agree 
that #1 was better.  That's a pretty experienced set of people, with 
judgement I tend to trust.

Why not just have two modes, controlled by an environment variable, 
link-time option, or run-time variable?  In the first mode, cancellation 
would not be an exception and nothing but pthread_cleanup_push'd code is 
run, and stack unwinding of all kinds is totally ignored.  In the second 
mode, cancellation would be an exception; nothing more, nothing less.
