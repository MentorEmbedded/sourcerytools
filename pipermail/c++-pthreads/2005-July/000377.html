In RHEL3 it is in /usr/include/nptl/pthread.h.

&gt;<i> That means that, as you say, you've committed to using an exception to

I wouldn't say that.  NPTL simply requires that class destructors
are run during cancellation's forced unwinding.  I don't see why it would
imply something about catch (...) though, it still doesn't mean cancellation
is an exception, just that some mechanism runs the class destructors.
