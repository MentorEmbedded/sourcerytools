</I>&gt;<i> &gt;There is no interaction between POSIX cancellation cleanup and C++

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and GNU/Linux started implementing pthread_cleanup_push as a destructor 
</I>&gt;<i> a while back.  So, now, there's no way to run pthread cleanups without

</I>&gt;<i> GLIBC (to put it back the way it used to be), and, of course, 
</I>&gt;<i> recompilation of all pthread_cleanup-using binaries.
</I>
POSIX doesn't forbid running destructors; it says nothing about them.
The specification above says that if there are any of the users' to 
be run, the effect is undefined.  Run them, don't run them, crash, 
whatever you like.  It's easy to conform, because it demands nothing 
beyond what J. Random POSIX C does already.  

All I propose requiring is that whatever it does, it stop running 
cleanup handlers where the cancellation_context object is, and throw.  
Conveniently, it also guarantees that in portable code there are no 
more cleanup handlers to be run.

So, maybe the cancellation_context registers a cleanup handler that 
throws an exception, short-circuiting a cleanup loop; or maybe it 
does nothing, because an exception is what has been running those 
cleanup handlers, and will now go on to run the users' destructors 
and catch clauses.  Either way conforms, and you don't have to know 
much about your C library to implement either one.

&gt;<i> &gt;Of course testing doesn't tell you whether it has defined behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True -- but that is in fact the behavior that was defined in the last 
</I>&gt;<i> iteration of that debate that the behavior shown was what was wanted. 
</I>&gt;<i> That behavior isn't an accident.
</I>
Wanted by whom?  As I recall, the &quot;zero uptake!&quot; crowd meant for no 
library (C or C++) to work right unless it had been written with full 
expectation of system calls and C library functions throwing exceptions,
even in destructors, even during ordinary-exception unwinding.  Falling
out of the catch clause was just one sticky detail.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I think the only reasonable choices are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;1) Fall off the end of the catch clause in the usual way, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;thread is still cancelled.  Encountering another cancellation point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;will result in re-raising the cancellation exception.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;2) Fall off the end of the catch clause in the usual way, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;thread is no longer cancelled.  It can be re-cancelled, but until it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;is, it will operate normally.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It doesn't matter much which it does; probably (1) is fine, as far as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that goes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that the choice doesn't matter much.  Heck, this whole issue 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't matter much to me; I'm just trying to keep us from going in
</I>&gt;<i> some really bad direction...
</I>
They did that a long time ago.  Our only hope is to undo the damage
within the context of C++ programs.

&gt;<i> &gt;Making the spec depend on compiler support practically guarantees 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that most users won't get anything reasonable, because that depends 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;on &quot;uptake&quot; by people implacably hostile to C++.  That's whey we're 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;at this impasse in the first place.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing we're talking about requires compiler support per se; it's
</I>&gt;<i> all C library support -- including your proposal, if I understand it
</I>&gt;<i> correctly, since you want to not do unwinding when inside a
</I>&gt;<i> cancellation region, which requires changing pthread_cleanup_push
</I>&gt;<i> not to be a destructor.
</I>
OK, not compiler support; compiler-runtime support.

People have been posting about how to keep cancellation from 
happening during ordinary-exception unwinding, or while a destructor 
is active.  (Most who think it's fine to throw from C-library functions 
-- specified by the standard never to throw -- pause at exceptions 
coming out of random destructors.)  All this requires an intimate 
relationship between the exception ABI and the cancellation apparatus.

Nothing I wrote says that pthread cleanup mustn't be done with a 
destructor, underneath.  There's no way for a conforming program to 
tell.  That makes it easy to implement without knowing any ABI 
details of how unwinding is done.  That's half the point: it means 
third parties probably can implement it independently of what their 
C library vendor has done -- or has categorically refused to do -- 
just by reimplementing a few pthread functions.  

The other half is that regular libraries can have well-defined 
semantics in real threaded C++ programs, even with POSIX-standard 
cancellation bombs exploding left and right, and without depending 
on blind luck.  If we don't rescue the libraries, whatever we do
end up with won't matter to real-world programmers.
