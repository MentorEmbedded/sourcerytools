</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem as I see it is that we have 2 distinct communities of programmers, with a small intersection - Posix thread users and C++ users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The C++ community addresses a wide variety of problem domains and deals with many users who never need Posix cancellation - indeed may never run on any Posix system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, many Posix threaders may code in C or other posix-friendly lanuages without worrying about C++.  The posix-cancellation rules were developed for this set of customers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> C++ has very clear resource acquisition/release semantics through object construction/destruction that apply across its broad spectrum of users.  This is a fundamental, invioble rule of the language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I am reading here is that this large group of users now need to be aware of some quite complicated posix-specific semantics to understand when and why their guarantees will not hold, and learn some as-yet unclear new fundamental technique to wrap resources in any 'portable' code they wish to publish.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Quite simply, I believe that is far too great a burden for the casual C++ user.  They are already struggling under the burden of a complicated language without us expecting them to understand intricacies of thread safety and lifetimes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The people actively working in the posix/C++ subset are much more familiar with these complex issues, and I believe the burden is on them to find a compromise that will not impact on the non-expert user who is NOT using this combination.  I do not pretend this is an easy task though ;&#172;)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; practices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's incompatible with cancel-unaware C++ code. Note that it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incompatible with cancel-unaware C code as well, but that didn't
