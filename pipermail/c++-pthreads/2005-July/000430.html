But being able to do do something is not the same as being
able to do something safely.

</I>
I don't know where you got that idea.  AFIK the mechanism predateds C++.

&gt;<i> ... but C++, a language with exceptions and almost a decade of experience

</I>
Yes, because it is unsafe, and C++ wants to be safer than C.

&gt;<i> Responsible? 
</I>
Yes, this is the only responsible thing.  In C, thread
cancellation is difficult to use correctly, and usage is easily
broken when one composes a system out of modules/libraries written
by different individuals (possibly without access to sources).
