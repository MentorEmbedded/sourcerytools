As I said, it doesn't matter if it is or isn't.  You may read that

</I>
Any pthread can be a target of pthread_cancel().  If you want some 
mechanism to ensure that a thread always ignores cancellations, 
regardless of any calls it, or libraries it uses, perform, I have 
nothing to propose.  

What we're talking about here is mechanisms to control what happens 
when a thread is already in a cancelled state.  As Wil had proposed, 
a thread in a C++ program starts out with the cancel state having no 
effect on any operation.  If the thread turns on some form of response 
(by constructing one of Wil's objects, however implemented), then at 
any point within its scope where something is supposed to happen (e.g.  
a cancellation point), something happens.  Precisely what happens 
then would depend on what sort of Wil-object is in scope.  

If &quot;what happens&quot; is an exception, then the client sees an exception.
(Library clients don't generally get to say whether they want to handle 
exceptions, iostreams notwithstanding).  

Note that I am not assuming this is all built on top of some existing
POSiX C pthreads implementation, although maybe with some tricky 
linker manipulations it could be.  I interpret Wil's example code only
as a welcome attempt inject some concreteness into the discussion.
