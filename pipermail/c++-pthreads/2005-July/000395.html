Good point.

However, that seems orthogonal to the other issues; we could certainly 
have #1 disallow cancellation in all destructors, if we wanted.  I don't 
really know how we plan to do that in #2, without inserting additional 
code in every destructor, which seems unfortunate.

</I>
The compiler must know that cancellation points may throw exceptions, as 
otherwise it may have optimized away exception unwind information, as it 
would when calling any &quot;nothrow&quot; function.

However, I realize that you're asking about user code, more than about 
the compiler.
