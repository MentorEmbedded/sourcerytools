&gt;<i> OK, let me clarify my position.  For a new C++ threading library, I would
</I>&gt;<i> continue to prefer scheme #1.  But this isn't a new library, it's an
</I>&gt;<i> extension of an existing library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main benefit of scheme #2 is that existing pthread_cancel-safe C++ code
</I>&gt;<i> written to use pthread_cleanup_push/pop continues to work.  
</I>
What do you mean by &quot;work?&quot;  Can you explain the issues here, and show
just what would be broken by scheme #1?

&gt;<i> Tangent follows:
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------
</I>&gt;<i> WRT scheme #1, various people have wondered why re-asserting cancellation
</I>&gt;<i> in the exception's destructor is necessary.  It's necessary because as I
</I>&gt;<i> said in my first message, if someone specifically told the thread to go
</I>&gt;<i> away, they don't want it to recover, they want it to go away.  The thread
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't get to second-guess that request, it has to go away.  It can take
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrarily long to get around to actually going away, but it can't
</I>&gt;<i> actually decide not to.  It especially can't decide this implicitly, as a
</I>&gt;<i> side-effect of code written to handle exceptions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is also the rationale for choosing not to make cancellation a proper
</I>&gt;<i> exception, which leads to scheme #2.
</I>
As Alexander says, a thread can always disable cancellation and never
re-enable it.  AFAICT, the idea that we can somehow force a thread to
cancel via a synchronous notification is just a myth.  I don't think
we can make any sensible decisions until face reality.
