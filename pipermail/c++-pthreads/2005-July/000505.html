<PRE>
I got lost in this discussion a week or two ago, but my sense is that
not much progress is being made because we are getting stuck in
details.  I think we have to try to deal with some large principles of
importance to the various participants.  For example, it's important
to me that

   Otherwise-correct C++ code not written to explicitly deal with
   cancellation should have a good chance of remaining correct in a
   POSIX environment with cancellation exceptions

However, it may yet be possible to convince me to give that one up.  I
think it's important to sort out the big principles and then weed out
any major incompatibilities among them, prioritize if necessary, and
when all that's done, think about how (or if) they can be implemented.

Of course, maybe you guys are all going like gangbusters and I'm just
too stupid to keep up.  If so, please forge on ahead without me!
