Within a cancellation context scope, you have bog-standard POSIX C 
cancellation semantics.  Outside it, you have standard C++ semantics.  
There is no interaction between POSIX cancellation cleanup and C++ 
exceptions, so no possibility of surprises, and no hard choices.
(Anybody who provides definitions can do it without breaking any 
code that doesn't depend on them.)

The point is to keep POSIX thread cancellation from breaking every 
library.  C++ code is mostly useless without libraries, and libraries 
as a rule know nothing about cancellation.  

&gt;<i> For example, this program presently works on GNU/Linux (tested on RHEL 3):

</I>
Of course testing doesn't tell you whether it has defined behavior.

Most users don't use cancellation because it doesn't work right with 
C++.  The only people who using cancellation with C++, and happy, are 
self-selected: the ones who don't care that it doesn't really work.

&gt;<i> That means that the most important question we should answer is what to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Fall off the end of the catch clause in the usual way, but the thread 
</I>&gt;<i> is no longer cancelled.  It can be re-cancelled, but until it is, it

</I>
It doesn't matter much which it does; probably (1) is fine, as far as 
that goes.  Neither choice addresses the problem that the libraries we 
all depend on are unusable -- or worse, seem usable until it matters 
-- in threads that might be cancelled.  Testing doesn't reliably tell 
you if it matters.

Making the spec depend on compiler support practically guarantees 
that most users won't get anything reasonable, because that depends 
on &quot;uptake&quot; by people implacably hostile to C++.  That's whey we're 
at this impasse in the first place.
