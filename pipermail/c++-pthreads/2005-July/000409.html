</I>&gt;<i> | &gt; | | Supposing model #1 is accepted, then how do we cope with

</I>&gt;<i> | &gt; | that assumes destructors never throw, or, more generally, with code

</I>&gt;<i> | &gt; | points?
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt; Destructors that throw usually lead to brittle codes.  The
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt; problems are with those destructors, not with the cancellation model
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt; implemented for C++. The destructors should be fixed, because that
</I>&gt;<i> | &gt; problem is independent of multithreading.
</I>&gt;<i> | 
</I>&gt;<i> | I disagree; one of the problems with mapping cancellation requests to
</I>&gt;<i> | C++ exceptions is that certain system calls that did not throw before
</I>&gt;<i> | are changed into functions that do, and that existing (destructor or
</I>&gt;<i> | non-destructor) code won't always be able to deal with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the function (or destructor) has a throw() specification, it will
</I>&gt;<i> continue not to throw.  
</I>
Yeah, but at what cost?  Termination does not seem like a very
desirable response to a cancellation request that happens to occur
before a 'C' library call that ordinarily wouldn't throw.

&gt;<i> If it did not have that annotation then it was assumed to throw.
</I>
By the compiler, maybe, but not to programmers in general.  Few
programmers habitually use throw() on their destructors, but nearly
everybody who has learned to write exception-safe code assumes that no
destructor throws unless otherwise specified.

&gt;<i> If you want to have fine grained control, you might want to consider
</I>&gt;<i> telling std::terminate() and friends not to abort().
</I>
What do you have in mind?
