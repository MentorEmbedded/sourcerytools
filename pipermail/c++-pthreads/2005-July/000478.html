That wasn't clear to me.

I'd be OK with that -- but most people seem to want POSIX thread 
cancellation to throw an exception in contrast with:

&gt;<i> There is no interaction between POSIX cancellation cleanup and C++ 
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions, so no possibility of surprises, and no hard choices.
</I>
and GNU/Linux started implementing pthread_cleanup_push as a destructor 
a while back.  So, now, there's no way to run pthread cleanups without 
also doing stack unwinding.  To do bog-standard POSIX C cancellation 
semantics (i.e., without running destructors) would require changes to 
GLIBC (to put it back the way it used to be), and, of course, 
recompilation of all pthread_cleanup-using binaries.

&gt;<i> Of course testing doesn't tell you whether it has defined behavior.
</I>
True -- but that is in fact the behavior that was defined in the last 
iteration of that debate that the behavior shown was what was wanted. 
That behavior isn't an accident.

&gt;&gt;<i>I think the only reasonable choices are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>1) Fall off the end of the catch clause in the usual way, but the thread 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>is still cancelled.  Encountering another cancellation point will result

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>2) Fall off the end of the catch clause in the usual way, but the thread 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>is no longer cancelled.  It can be re-cancelled, but until it is, it

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't matter much which it does; probably (1) is fine, as far as 
</I>&gt;<i> that goes.
</I>
I agree that the choice doesn't matter much.  Heck, this whole issue 
doesn't matter much to me; I'm just trying to keep us from going in some 
really bad direction...

&gt;<i> Making the spec depend on compiler support practically guarantees

</I>&gt;<i> at this impasse in the first place.  
</I>
Nothing we're talking about requires compiler support per se; it's all C 
library support -- including your proposal, if I understand it 
correctly, since you want to not do unwinding when inside a cancellation 
region, which requires changing pthread_cleanup_push not to be a destructor.
