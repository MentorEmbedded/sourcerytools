Not sure about this one.  I can think of two ways of achieving 
stickiness through user code:

(*) Have the destructor of the cancellation exception re-cancel the 
current thread.  The problem with this is that the user has no real 
choice here - in your example, it would imply that the threads in the 
thread pool cannot be recycled.

(*) Have the user code re-cancel the current thread when a cancellation 
exception is caught and finalized.  The problem with this is that it 
requires the user to explicitly catch a cancellation exception by name. 
  It won't happen if the cancellation exception is finalized in a 'catch 
(...)' block; instead, the cancellation request will go unnoticed.

</I>
Yes, this is incompatible with the rule I stated above.  Damn.

Not sure how serious it is, though.  Under the design I suggested, the 
first thing a thread's user code would do is disable cancellation, only 
to re-enable it for selected regions of code.

I would expect any exception finalization to take place *outside* of 
those regions; therefore, if the thread continues to run, cancellation 
will necessarily have been re-enabled before the user code hits another 
intended cancellation point.

So it seems that, for the sake of POSIX compatibility, the rule I stated 
above can be dropped without risking unintended suppression of 
cancellation requests.
