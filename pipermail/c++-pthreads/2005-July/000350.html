One way to look at it is that scheme #1 blows up, true.  But not
necessarily by calling std::unexpected.  Those functions do not
implicitly acquire an empty exception-specification -- they are simply
required not to throw.  If they start throwing, they break user code
by violating its expectations.

A more correct way to look at it, IMO, is that an implementation of
C++ that throws from standard 'C' functions by default (other than
when the user does something documented to cause undefined behavior)
is nonconforming to the C++ standard.  In other words, those functions
simply can't throw in C++, at least not without explicitly being given
permission by the program.  I would:

  0. Continue to forbid those functions to throw in C++, to preserve
     conformance

  1. Add a non-throwing mechanism to report cancellation from those
     functions, such as extended values of errno.

  2. Optional: As an extension, provide a parallel set of functions
     (in a namespace other than :: or std:: ) that can throw.

  3. Optional: As an extension, provide a way to enable the normal 'C'
     library to throw cancellation
