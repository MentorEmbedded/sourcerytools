</I>That is not the case in Linux pthread implementation, as I replied to
Mark Mitchel (see my earlier email). Jason indicated in #3 that abort()
is called cancellation exception is rethrown - and that is consistent
with my experience. BTW, even if this discussion did not converge, I
enjoyed technical aspect of it immensely. Thanks to all.

Personally, I think everyone's stated their opinions well enough; it 
doesn't seem like we're getting anywhere.

I'd like to hear from Jason Merrill, as he was the person brave enough 
to restart this discussion, and as he's probably the person most 
motivated to actually do something...

Jason, have any of us persuaded you of anything, or are you just 
wallowing in your own despair?
