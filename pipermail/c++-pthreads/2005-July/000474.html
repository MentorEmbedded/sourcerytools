This strikes me as still unnecessarily complicated.  Do we need a #6?
So be it.  In #6,

 * Threads are initiated with cancellation disabled.

 * Cancellation is sticky. 

 * On construction of a cancellation_context object C, if the thread 
   is in a cancelled state, an ordinary exception is thrown.

 * During the lifetime of C, the semantics of destructors and catch 
   blocks are undefined if the thread is cancelled and a POSIX C 
   cancellation point is encountered.  Any cleanup ends at the scope 
   of C, and control leaves this scope via an ordinary exception.
   
 * Outside the scope of a cancellation_context, the effect of 
   pthread_cleanup_push etc. is undefined.

 * Other context types provided may have different semantics, such 
   as one in which certain system calls fail if the thread is
   cancelled.

This shouldn't need any compiler support, and the thread runtime
shouldn't need to know any details about the exception mechanism.
