It was posited that cancellation mapped to an exception, and that so 
long as this exception was rethrown, stack unwinding happened in the 
usual way.

I understand that you think that mapping cancellation to an exception, 
and thereby changing C functions that did not previously throw 
exceptions into functions that do, is a bad idea.  However, I think one 
of the axioms for this discussion was that this is in fact a good idea.

In other words, I think the context here is that we're assuming POSIX 
cancellation points throw a cancellation exception; the question is how 
things behave from there.  I don't think that throwing out this 
assumption is productive, because I don't think you'll ever get the 
broader community to accept anything else.

I'm not necessarily disliking what you're saying; I'm just don't see it 
as pragmatic.  However, if you can do it all at user level, and people 
like your solution, more power to you!

All in all, I think I've once again spent quite enough time on this 
discussion.  The status quo is actually OK with me, in that if your 
program does not abort, it behaves in a way I find plausible.  So, until 
there's some indication that someone is going to try to actually 
implement something, I'll just go back to worrying about other things.
