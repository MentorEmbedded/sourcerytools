To have cancellation exceptions come from C functions breaks all code 
that was written assuming C functions don't throw: i.e., all existing 
C++ code that calls C functions.  That's rather more than &quot;none&quot;.

It's possible that lots (not all) of exception-safe C++ code would, 
as part of being prepared for exceptions from C++ functions called 
nearby, survive throws from C functions.  It doesn't matter: C 
libraries equipped to exit safely via exception are, for all practical 
purposes, nonexistent.

&gt;<i> It is true that so far we've been able to assume that a function
</I>&gt;<i> written in C doesn't throw when thread cancellation is not in use.
</I>&gt;<i> But we'll still be able to assume that.

Very funny.

&gt;<i> &gt;2) Are exceptions safe, in general?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We've spent the last decade in learning how to use them safely. It
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't make sense to discard this knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When 'new' was changed to throw this broke millions of lines of code,
</I>&gt;<i> and C++ survived the transition. The introduction of cancellation
</I>&gt;<i> points - even into the C part of the standard library - is almost a
</I>&gt;<i> non-event compared to that.
</I>
At least four orders of magnitude more C++ code is in production use 
than when the change to operator new took place.  Thread cancellation 
is far from important enough to consider causing even a little of such 
breakage.

Need cancellation only work accidentally (i.e. not) in threads that 
rely on libraries?  If so, cancellation is not really worth discussing: 
C++ code that doesn't use libraries might as well be C code.  If 
cancellation is supposed to be useful for any real programs, common 
libraries must not be broken by it.  We know how to do that.  We need 
not be confused by what POSiX has chosen to do to its own private
version of C.
