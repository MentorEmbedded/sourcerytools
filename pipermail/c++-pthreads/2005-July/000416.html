I agree that if people always disable cancellation in destructors implicit 
suppression doesn't matter.

But we have a number of conflicting goals. We want:

1. To specify sensible C++ cancellation semantics for new C++MT code.
2. To not break existing C++ code much.
3. To not break existing Posix code much.

Since Posix semantics are approximated quite well by just suppressing 
cancellation during stack unwinding, and since this suppression (arguably) 
doesn't affect old C++ code or new C++ code in a negative way (*), it seems 
a good compromise.

We also want

4. To not break C++ exception handling or introduce special cases.

which is why I think that #1 with implicit suppression is the best 
alternative of those described so far.

(*) A function that tells us whether stack unwinding is in progress could 
even prove useful for new C++ code.
