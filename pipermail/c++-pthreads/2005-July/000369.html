</I>
Yes.  If there had been a POSIX C++ binding years ago, based on the Tru64
model, it could have used exceptions.  If we somehow managed to throw
together a C++ binding this year, it probably could still use exceptions.
But I don't think that's likely to happen, and in its absence the C binding
is the de facto C++ binding, and I think we need to support it.

I should state that more strongly: I would be very much in favor of a POSIX
C++ binding that made cancellation an exception.  But we need it last year,
and as far as I know there isn't even a subcommittee working on it; this
mailing list doesn't have any formal standing.

&gt;<i> I understand the issue is tough, but I don't see much gain in having
</I>&gt;<i> another exception model with subtly different semantics.
</I>
It's not that subtle, it just does stack unwinding, like a sequence of
returns.

&gt;<i> It is true that many codes have been written with POSIX C binding, more
</I>&gt;<i> has to come as C++ codes.  I'm not convinced that we should compromise
</I>&gt;<i> the future.
</I>
The future can use a different interface.  Or extend pthread_setcanceltype.
PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED_EXCEPTION, anyone?
