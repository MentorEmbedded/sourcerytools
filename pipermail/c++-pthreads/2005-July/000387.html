But if it becomes part of the C++ standard, it becomes part of all C++ 
libraries, including new C++ threading libraries.

</I>
Keeping the cancellation request active doesn't need to be done by 
reasserting in the destructor. It can simply be left active. Since 
cancellation is implicitly disabled during stack unwinding, the request will 
automatically &quot;reassert itself&quot; when the exception is caught, independent of 
how many times the exception is copied and destroyed.

Providing a way to clear a cancellation request is useful when tasks are 
executed in a thread pool and it's only the task that needs to be cancelled, 
not its thread shell.

If a thread has been explicitly written to oppose cancellations, there is 
little to be gained by twisting the rules to make it cancellable. The thread 
has been designed as uncancellable. It will probably break if cancelled.
