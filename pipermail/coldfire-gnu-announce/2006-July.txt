Subject: Sourcery G++ 4.1-14 for ColdFire now available
Message-ID: <44A886C4.3000304@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery has released Sourcery G++ 4.1-14 for ColdFire.

Notable improvements in this release, relative to 4.1-11:

* Toolchains for ColdFire GNU/Linux are now available, in addition to
updates for ColdFire uClinux and ColdFire ELF.

* GDB now supports hardware watchpoints and breakpoints.

* The ColdFire BDM stub, designed for use with P&E Micro's debugging
hardware, now provides much improved semi-hosting support.  You can use
this functionality to access files on the host system from target
programs in the ColdFire ELF toolchains.  The stub is also considerably
faster.

* The uClinux toolchains now support position-independent code, shared
libraries, and prioritized constructors and destructors.  The linker can
now reduce the size of flat objects by merging constant data and by
optimizing unwind information.

Sourcery G++ Lite toolchains (containing the command-line tools) are
available from:

Sourcery G++ Personal Edition toolchains (including an Eclipse-based
IDE) and Professional Edition toolchains (including the IDE and
unlimited support) are available from the CodeSourcery's online store:
