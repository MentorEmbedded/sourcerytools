Subject: New ColdFire uClinux toolchains available
Message-ID: <4477894C.90506@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery has released Sourcery G++ 4.1-11 for ColdFire uClinux
toolchains.  The 4.1-11 release contains the following major improvements:

* Support for hardware debugging using P&E Micro's devices.

* Support for using the "elf2flt" command on Windows, without Cygwin.

* Correction of a problem which caused the "system" library function to
fail.  (This problem resulted from a failure to maintain proper stack
alignment.)
