CodeSourcery is pleased to announce a new version of Sourcery G++ for
ColdFire.

This release is an update to the recent 4.1-30 release, with fixes for
the following critical issues:

* An internal error from the compiler on functions using
__attribute__((interrupt)) has been eliminated.

* A code-generation problem that affected functions using only
floating-point registers has been corrected.

* A defect in GLIBC's copying of wide characters has been corrected.

* Additional CCS examples are included.  A confusing error message
relating to use of P&E drivers has been improved.

Enjoy!
