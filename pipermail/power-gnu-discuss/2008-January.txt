Subject: MPC55xx toolchain support + JTAG Nexus debugging for Power architecture..
Message-ID: <80F2F220C3A35342A3E13D35988E0A4B02555C60@newman.na.medrad.com>

 

I noticed that the CodeSourcery Power EABI toolchain lists only support
for e300, e500, e600 and PowerQUICC.

 

The Freescale MPC55xx series uses an e200 code I believe; I was just
wondering if anyone has successfully used the CodeSourcery toolchain
with MPC55xx series microcontrollers?

 

Also, I noticed in a previous posting that apparently the Power
toolchain does not contain support for P&E Nexus USB Multilink
debugging. 

 

Does the Power toolchain support any Nexus USB debugger (such as
Lauterbach)? Or does it not support any JTAG Nexus debuggers?

 

 

 

 

Regards,

 

Greg Bednarek
