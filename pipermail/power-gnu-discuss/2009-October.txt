Subject: VLE instructions for the MPC5566
Message-ID: <4AE96137.6050106@westcontrol.com>

Hi,

Does anyone know if CodeSourcery gcc can generate VLE instructions for 
microcontrollers like the MPC5566 (e200z6 core with VLE)?

mvh.,

David

Sourcery G++ cannot generate VLE code.  (Neither can the FSF version of
GCC.)  We have talked with Freescale about this in the past, but they
have not felt that there was sufficient interest in GCC on these
processors to merit investment there.

Thanks,

That seems a shame, but I understand the problem.  I don't imagine that 
the combination of MPC55xx and gcc is very common, at least when 
translated into units sold for Freescale (or subscriptions sold for 
CodeSourcery!).  Perhaps VLE will be used in more PPC devices, with a 
wider audience, and the situation will change in the future.

Thanks for the information,

David
