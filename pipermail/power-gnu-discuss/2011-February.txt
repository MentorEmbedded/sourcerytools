Subject: getrusage

Seems the function times calls the function getrusage, but this function isn't defined anywhere. Any hints what I have to do ? And for what this function is used.
I run the code on an system without any OS.

c:/program files/codesourcery/sourceryglite/bin/../lib/gcc/powerpc-eabi/4.5.1/../../../../powerpc-eabi/lib\libc.a(lib_a-times.o): In function `times':
times.c:(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `getrusage'

saludos

You need to define a getrusage function in your code which does
whatever is needed for your bare-metal application. It's up to you to
decide how to count time (given that you have no OS).

Cheers,
Carlos.

Subject: gcc cross compiler for MPC8260
Message-ID: <4D61E80A.8040100@cdotb.ernet.in>

Hi,

We want to use gcc to cross compile 'C Source code' to a target board(with
freescale PowerPC-MPC8260).

The Source code will bring up the target(using assembly language), and
run the code written in 'C' to test the board functionality. No
OS(embedded OS) is involded in this source code.

We want to use gcc to cross compile this code to PowerPC - MPC8260.

If we want to use gcc c cross compiler for MPC8260, what is procedure to
be followed in windows?

Please help me in using gcc as a cross compiler for PowerPC in windows
OS.
Any references to documents/application notes/links would be
appreciated.
