Use of CS3
I am in the process of evaluating CodeSourcery GCC toolkit for use
with our own board. Our board is a MPC5200B based board, not very
different from the Lite5200. I have successfully build an application
(small hello world) based on the "Getting Started guide" and running
it from uBoot. I have used the MPC8349E-mITX-uboot.ld link file, and
made a few adjustments to it.
Now I want to test some more functionality. I want to test with
interrupt, but I have big problems to understand how to do this
together with the CS3-library. Does someone have example code which
shows how to write and install an interrupt together with the CS3?
Is there more documentation then the "Getting started guide" of the CS3-lib?

I use the following:
Version: Sourcery G++ Lite 4.2-138
Target: powerpc-eabi
Host: WinXp

At present Sourcery G++ for Power EABI only supports UBoot integration 
with CS3, we do not currently provide support for CPU interrupt vectors. 
We are looking into this enhancement for future releases.

The Getting Started guide is the full documentation for CS3.

Cheers,
Carlos.

Tnx. for quick ansver, but I still don't get the big picture. Maybe I
 can use the Uboot integration as it is? I want to use Uboot as
 bootloader, and from uboot launch by own program. My own program will
 never return to uboot.
 Am I able to install interrupts by using it like this, or is this what
 you say is unsupported?
