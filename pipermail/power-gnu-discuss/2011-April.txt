Subject: Windows 7 64-bit
Message-ID: <BANLkTimSbFpofXUD-eONWFVeAfTKcDdpHQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have installed *freescale-4.4-78-powerpc-linux-gnu.exe*  in Windows 7
64-bit.
Everything installs fine but when I try to run***
powerpc-linux-gnu-gcc ?v*I get

powerpc-linux-gnu-gcc: ?v: No such file or directory
powerpc-linux-gnu-gcc: no input files

In the documentation, it states that for 64-bit systems I need to get the
32-bit host libraries.
Is this the problem and if so where do I get the 32-bit libraries?

Any help would be appreciated.

Seth
