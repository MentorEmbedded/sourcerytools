Subject: Change Target Endianess to Little-Endian
Message-ID: <49C8975F.3000302@gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to write a program  running in PowerPC MPC8347 in 
Little-Endian mode.
I've add "-mlittle" to compile line but ld.exe cannot build my program.
It's saying like this: "d:/program files/codesourcery/sourcery g++ 
lite/bin/../lib/gcc/powerpc-linux-gnu/4.2.1/../../../../powerpc-linux-gnu/bin/ld.exe: 
main.o: compiled for a little endian system and target is big endian"

Here is my test program:

int num = 1;
if(*(char *)&num == 1)
    printf("Little-Endian\n");
else
    printf("Big-Endian\n");

And i want the result is: Little-Endian
  

Can anybody help me?

Regards,
Huy Phuc
