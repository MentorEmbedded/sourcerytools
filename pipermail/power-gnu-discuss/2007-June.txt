Subject: configuration script for initializing the powerpc-eabi-gdb with a USB NEXUS Multilink
Message-ID: <5B0591573C95AA42A0898D726C43D7F066BD37@rb8srv04.tz-mikroelektronik.de>

Hi,

I try to debug programs with the Sourcery G++ Lite debugger
powerpc-eabi-gdb in Eclipse on a MPC5567-platform via the P&E USB
PowerPC NEXUS Multilink. But I don't get a connection to the Mulltilink.
Which initialize commands are required to download the elf-file and
start the debugging process?
Can anybody help me?

Regards,
Thorsten Kopp

Sourcery G++ Lite Edition doesn't include support for the P&E Multilink.

Our ColdFire toolchains do support the P&E debuggers, and we are
considering adding Multilink support to our Personal and Professional
Edition toolchains for Power.

Best regards,
