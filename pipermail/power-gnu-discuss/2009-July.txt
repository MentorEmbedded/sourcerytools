Subject: Gdb command watch issue hardware requests
Message-ID: <0A1FE637C2C7E148B9573BB60CC630E53A294D@zch01exm26.fsl.freescale.net>


Hi guys,

I am now developing in gdb remote mode.
I heard from someone that 'hbreak' and 'watch' should make the gdb frontend issue requests for hardware break/watchpoints.
(gdb >= 6.8 for hardware breakpoint over remote connections)

I checked that 'hbreak' indeed issue hardware breakpoint request but 'watch' still use software breakpoint and single step.
The toolchain version I used is gcc-4.3.74-eglibc-2.8.74-5 in which gdb version is 6.8.50.20080821-cvs. Does it not enough to support hardware assistant watch?

Does anyone know something about this?

What hardware are you using for debugging?

That is correct, but only if the ICE and CPU support hardware 
break/watchpoints.

Does your hardware, both ICE and CPU, support hardware watchpoints?

Cheers,
Carlos.
