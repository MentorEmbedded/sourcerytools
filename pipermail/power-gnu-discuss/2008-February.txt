Is there anyway that this patch (or its equivalent for powerpc64 on 
recent glibc) make it's way into your next release.

http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2005-10/msg00012.html

It was killed for lack of support for the 601 and some other old 4xx 
processors and will probably never be in mainline glibc but since your 
toolchain seem to be targeted to recent freescale processors it should 
not be an issue.

Also, packaging uclibc with this toolchain would be great.  While it's 
not difficult to compile,having it in one package would make it easier 
for us.

We are using e500 and e600.

Thanks.
