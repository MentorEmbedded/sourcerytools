Can you elaborate on what you mean by &quot;running a parallel vsip++ 
program&quot; ? Are you running it with mpirun ?


&gt;<i> I figure this is could be due to two reasons:

</I>&gt;<i> 1. VSIPL++ lite doesn't support parallel features. It'd be nice if the

</I>
That's a fair point. I believe the offered functionality (as far as the 
API is concerned) is the same, though the 'Lite' edition may not provide 
as many platform-specific optimizations, and thus run slower there.

&gt;<i> 2. During installation I was supposed to include an option to enable
</I>&gt;<i> parallel support but I didn't and so it doesn't work. I didn't find
</I>&gt;<i> anything in the &quot;Getting Started&quot; guide which mentioned enabling
</I>&gt;<i> built-in parallel support (just external libraries like MPI) but if this
</I>&gt;<i> is the case I would be ever grateful if someone could provide the
</I>&gt;<i> correct options to use.
</I>
You may enable parallel support by specifying --enable-parallel. By 
default, configure probes to find a suitable MPI installation.

However, as you have requested an evaluation license recently, you will 
get a binary version which is configured and built with all the right 
flags, so you don't have to do any of this yourself.

Thanks,
		Stefan
