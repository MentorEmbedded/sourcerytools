There's definitely a bikeshed in here...

The GNU way is that there are &quot;canonical&quot; triplets and then
non-canonical abbreviations.  The canonical format is $cpu-$vendor-$os,
so &quot;sparc-sun-solaris2.8&quot; if your system is built by Sun, and
&quot;sparc-acme-solaris2.8&quot; if your system is built by Acme, but contains a
SPARC, and is running Sun's operating system.  The world isn't always
this simple, and very little software pays attention to the $vendor value.

For Sourcery G++, we generally elide $system, and use a non-canonical
$cpu-$os format, which is equivalent to $cpu-unknown-$os.  So, for
example, &quot;powerpc-eabi&quot; is the target triplet for our Power EABI
toolchains, even though &quot;powerpc-unknown-eabi&quot; is the canonical triplet.
 Putting &quot;unknown&quot; into all our file names makes things any easier for
users -- and it just looks like we don't know things. :-)

The way GNU software is supposed to work is that you take the triplet
provided by the user and then run it through config.sub to get a
canonnical name.  Then, you make all your substantive decisions
(optimization, what functionality to include, tec.) based on the
canonical name, so that whether the user wrote &quot;powerpc-eabi&quot; or
&quot;powerpc-unknown-eabi&quot; makes no difference.  AC_CANONICAL_HOST is the
autoconf macro that canoicalizes --host=... for you.

I guess Joseph is right that the &quot;-&quot; in &quot;powerpc-cell&quot; might be a
hazard.  I think $cpu should definitely start with &quot;powerpc&quot;, since
these are Power CPUs, and a lot of things expect to match powerpc*-*-*.
 It looks like GCC expects you do to &quot;--target=powerpc-eabi&quot; (or
whatever) and then ad &quot;--with-cpu=cell&quot; to say that the default CPU is a
Cell.

So, we could add --with-cpu, and then turn on the Cell bits only if the
CPU specified is Cell.  That would also give us a mechanism for things
like --with-cpu=970 to say &quot;optimize for a 970 CPU&quot;.  Of course, since
we're a library, most of those decisions can be made with &quot;#ifdef
__970__&quot; style checks -- but perhaps not all.  (Or, we could jut have
--enable-cell, which is less general, but perhaps simpler.)

So, concretely, here is my revised recommendation:

1. Ensure that our configure scripts are looking at the canonical value
of $host, not the non-canonical $host_alias.

2. If reasonably convenient, add --with-cpu=..., and determine that we
are using Cell iff (a) $host_cpu matches powerpc*, and (b) $with_cpu
matches cell*.  (The *s allow people to add version information.)

3. If that's not convenient, recommend &quot;powerpccell-linux-gnu&quot; as the
host triplet for Cell GNU/Linux and then determine that we are using
Cell iff $host_cpu matches powerpccell*.

&gt;<i> P.S.: Mark, could you also comment on whether MCOE should get
</I>&gt;<i> powerpc-mercury-mcoe or powerpc-unknown-mcoe?  I'm not very certain
</I>&gt;<i> about that one at all.
</I>
Here, I think &quot;powerpc-mcoe&quot; is the obvious choice.  We don't care who
made the hardware.  Again, if we're using the canonical triplet
correctly, we should however match $host against powerpc*-*-mcoe* (which
means &quot;any version of PowerPC, any system vendor, and any version of MCOE&quot;).
