We do the same thing in the compiler; &quot;i += j&quot; is treated exactly like
&quot;i = i + j&quot;.  If there are special operations for update you want to
apply them in both cases, i.e., you want to optimize &quot;i = i + j&quot; and &quot;i
= j + i&quot; if the user happens to right it that way.  So, first you turn
&quot;i += j&quot; into &quot;i = i + j&quot;; then you (later) look for the update case.

In VSIPL++, you could do that at runtime-dispatch time.  In a compiler,
there's generally very little runtime dispatch; these things are decided
up front.  That does suggest that, in the long run, you may want to do
compile-time dispatch for the += case if you have a library that
specially supports that case.  But, you'll probably want to do the
runtime dispatch anyhow, and that will get you most of the bang.

So, I think your strategy makes sense.
