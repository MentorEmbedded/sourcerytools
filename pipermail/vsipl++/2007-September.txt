Subject: Compile problems with reference implementation and gnu 3.4.5
Message-ID: <E7191752EF4FAD498FD0E968F7A7DAF70AA340@mlbe2k5.cs.myharris.net>

Hi,

I am trying to port the reference implementation to Windows using MinGW
and gnu 3.4.5, and the doesn't like certain static methods within
template structs. The first error encountered while building the
tests/ref-impl programs is:

g++ -DUNIT_TEST_FAILURE_PRINT \
-I../../src -I/include \
-c math-matvec.cpp -o math-matvec.o
../../src/vsip/core/matvec.hpp: In function `typename

I cannot spot any errors in the source that would lead to this error.
The compiler doesn't have this issue with the GPL version of the code,
although there seems to be similar implementation patterns in that code
as well. The error does show up in the GPL version of the tests
(matvec-prod.cpp) if I force it to use the reference version via the
VSIP_IMPL_REF_IMPL flag. So I'm stuck trying to figure out why gnu 3.4.5
doesn't like the implementations of Evaluator in core/matvec.hpp. Any
clues would be appreciated.

Everett,

thanks for reporting this issue. I have tried to reproduce it on Linux
with g++ 3.4.5 (assuming that mingw 3.4.5 would use the same C++ frontend,
and thus expose the same problems as the stock g++ 3.4.5, but couldn't
see any problem. The compilation command you show works fine.

We will try to reproduce this on a Windows machine.

Meanwhile, can you provide us with some details as to how you configured
and built ? What options and commands did you use exactly ?

Thanks,
		Stefan

The build of the VSIPL++ library is done with "make -fGNUmakefile all",
and it succeeds. Then I change directories to tests/ref-impl and try
"make -fMakefile check". For the tests, the Makefile and Makefile.inc
files were updated for our directory structure. The error appears when
it gets to math-matvec.cpp file.

I've played some with the flags used to compile the tests (removed -O2
and -pedantic), but nothing has changed the result. I hope your attempt
on Windows reproduces the problem, but since it works for Linux, I'll
start looking for possible problems in our environment.

Thanks,

Everett

Subject: patch: minor fixes
Message-ID: <46E59344.8040206@codesourcery.com>

The attached patch fixes three issues:

* The default-option logic in configure.ac was wrong such that --enable-ref-impl
  and --without-lapack couldn't coexist.

* The src/core/vsip/fft.hpp file had a typo (exposed when built in ref-impl mode).

* The tests/ref-impl/GNUmakefile is obsolete and outdated, and thus is removed now.

OK to check in ?

Thanks,
		Stefan

(The -f option shouldn't be necessary. The reason we use GNUmakefile
 instead of Makefile is to make clear (to 'make') that we really require
 GNU make -- which detects GNUmakefiles automatically. Other versions of
 make won't be able to handle our build system anyway.)

That may be the root of the problem. tests/ref-impl/ doesn't come with
a 'Makefile', only with a 'GNUmakefile'. That, however, is obsolete, and
not used by our testing harness.

(Our testing harness uses QMTest, and to invoke it you run 'make check'
 from the toplevel directory. We also support compiling individual tests
 in a way as not to require QMTest, though the ref-impl test suite doesn't
 seem to be supported that way. I would suggest to modify / add to the
 tests_cxx_sources variable in tests/GNUmakefile.inc to include tests/ref-impl/*.cpp.

 Once that is done, you can run 'make tests/ref-impl/math-matvec' from the toplevel
 directory.)

As I can't reproduce this with my (Linux-based) version of GCC 3.4.5, and
since this looks like a C++ frontend issue, rather than a platform-specific
problem, I'm tempted to believe that the cause is related to your writing
your own Makefile for tests/ref-impl/.

Subject: VSIPL++ and Visual C++
Message-ID: <1B90921D44561C4A977E2604A5247075068508@mlbe2k4.cs.myharris.net>

From
http://www.codesourcery.com/public/vsiplplusplus/sourceryvsipl++-1.3/qui
ckstart/ch02s03.html, it is apparent that /building/ CodeSourcery
VSIPL++ requires the Intel C++ compiler. Once built, though, can the
library be used from Microsoft Visual C++ 2005?  If VSIPL++ were a C
library, the answer would obviously be yes because the ABI for C is
standardized and the header files contain little actual code.  However,
CodeSourcery VSIPL++ is C++, which makes for ABI issues between
compilers.  Also, it makes extensive use of templates and template
meta-programming techniques so quite a bit of the functionality is in
the public header files -- which the "client compiler" needs to process
to generate instantiated code.

So

(1) can a pre-compiled VSIPL++ library (such as the one here:
http://www.codesourcery.com/vsiplplusplus/1.3/download.html) be used
from Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 -- is MSVC 2005 "ISO C++ compliant"
enough?

(2) If so, then why can't VSIPL++ be /built/ using MSVC2005 -- assuming
that either individual licenses for IPP and MKL are obtained, or those
(presumably optional) elements are disabled when running configure.

(3) If not, the what is the point of using the /Qvc8 switch when
building VSIPL++ with the Intel C++ compiler? (Why worry about the MS
ABI if all clients of the library are required to icc anyway?)

Thanks,
Charles Wilson

thanks for your interest into Sourcery VSIPL++.

You are right, building Sourcery VSIPL++ requires a fairly standard-compliant
C++ compiler, and -- as we had to find out -- MSVC2005 unfortunately isn't
good enough.
Since most of the complex code is part of (public) headers, it will be
exposed to the end-user's compiler, too. Thus, MSVC2005 most likely won't
be able to compile applications using Sourcery VSIPL++.

This flag may indeed not be very meaningful in this context.
