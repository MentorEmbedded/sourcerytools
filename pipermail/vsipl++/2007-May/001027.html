</I>There were no changes, so I'm not sure what happened.  I'll try it again 
on a clean checkout and see if the problem repeats.

</I>That was not intentional.  Thanks for catching that.  The patch has 
changed quite a bit as I discussed it with Stefan and we determined a 
better way to do it.  Expect a new patch Here Soon.

A new question arose however:  Some time ago, we chose to put the HPEC 
benchmarks in a subdirectory of benchmarks/, much like the other 
specialized benchmarks, yet we gave it its own makefile so that it would 
stand alone a bit better.  This seems odd now.  I propose we move it 
alongside benchmarks/, perhaps as benchmarks_hpec/ to make it a little 
more obvious than 'hpec_kernel'.  We'll then mirror this arrangement 
upon installation.  Is this ok with you?

Regards,
