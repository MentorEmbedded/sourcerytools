<PRE>Jules,
We tried building vsipl++1.3 on Windows using the Cygwin enviroment, but had many problems. However (surprisingly) we were successful in building using standalone MinGW with Msys and gcc/g++/g77 3.4.5, with only two minor glitches:
1. MinGW didn't have sys/times.h, so we created one with just a tms structure which satisfied the make.
2. Modified vendor\fftw\kernel\alloc.c to allow compilation of our_alloc16()
 
The two build examples, fft.exe and example1.exe were linked and ran OK, which suggests that our compiler switches and linkage issues were resolved OK.
 
But we are still having a problem compiling the Judd/Cottel BeamformEx code (<A HREF="http://hpec-si.com/MinimumVarianceBeamformerExample.pdf">http://hpec-si.com/MinimumVarianceBeamformerExample.pdf</A>) in files BeamformEx.cpp and beam_steer_coeff.cpp
[See listing compile/link commands and errors at end of this message]
 
BeamformEx.cpp: pg 7
// Create a cholesky object
 vsip::chold&lt;vsip::cscalar_f, vsip::by_reference&gt;
          chold_object(vsip::chold&lt;vsip::cscalar_f, vsip::by_reference&gt;::lower,nh);
I was able to get this to compile by changing the first parameter of the constructor to (vsip::mat_uplo)0, since it seems to be looking for an enumeration of zero.
 
beam_steer_coeff.cpp: pg37
k *= (2.0 * M_PI/sv);
This statement causes the error, possibly due to incorrect overloading of *= operator. 
 
I can get all of the beamformer files to compile and link if I comment out this last statement. 
Is this still a config problem, or is this code possibly out of date? A comment on page 43 suggests that this is using a very early implementation of VSIPL++.
 
We are trying to get this beamformer working to do signal processing on some towed-array sonar data. Are there any other adaptive beamformers available similar to this in the VSIPL++ community, either commercially or as free software? 
 
Thanks for your help and suggestions,
John Day

Subject: Re: [vsipl++] fftm compile problem



John,

A couple of bits:

- It should be possible to build Sourcery VSIPL++ with MinGW on windows.
  Unfortunately, you won't be able to use MinGW with the windows binary
package from our website, because that has been built with Intel C++,
which IIUC has a different C++ ABI than GCC on windows.

To use MinGW, you will need to build the library from the source
package.  This requires you to run configure, so you will need either
MSys or cygwin (something to provide the equiv of /bin/sh).


- MinGW GCC 3.4.5 will work fine (we use 3.4.4 to build our Linux binary
pacakges).  GCC 4.1/4.2 will give better performance, but that is
another matter ...


- The compile error you're seeing is a result of the library not being
able to find a FFT backend.  This happens because you're missing some
macro definitions that need to be on the command line.

If you look in the file 'lib/pkgconfig/vsipl++.pc' of the binary
package, you will see a line:

cppflags=-I${includedir}  -DVSIP_IMPL_PAR_SERVICE=0
-DVSIP_IMPL_IPP_FFT=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_FLOAT=1
-DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_DOUBLE=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_LONG_DOUBLE=1
-DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_FLOAT=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_DOUBLE=1
-DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_LONG_DOUBLE=0 -DVSIP_IMPL_USE_CBLAS=2

These macros tell the library which FFT backends to use (in this case,
we're using the IPP FFT, which happens to be how the windows binary
package was configured).

Those definitions need to be on the command line when you compile.

You might retry compiling fft.cpp as

g++ -c -I/usr/local/include -DVSIP_IMPL_PAR_SERVICE=0
-DVSIP_IMPL_IPP_FFT=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_FLOAT=1
-DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_DOUBLE=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_LONG_DOUBLE=1
-DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_FLOAT=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_DOUBLE=1
-DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_LONG_DOUBLE=0 -DVSIP_IMPL_USE_CBLAS=2

That should fix the compilation errors.  However, the above mentioned
problem of ICC and MinGW C++ ABI's being incompatible still remains of
course!

- Sourcery VSIPL++ can be built with Cygwin too.


Do you have MSYS installed along with MinGW?  If so, you should
configure the library from the source package.  The following configure
command would be a good starting point:

        configure                               \
                --with-lapack=simple-builtin    \
                --enable-fft=builtin

Let us know how that works!

                                -- Jules
