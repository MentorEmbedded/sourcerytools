<PRE>John,

A couple of bits:

- It should be possible to build Sourcery VSIPL++ with MinGW on windows. 
  Unfortunately, you won't be able to use MinGW with the windows binary 
package from our website, because that has been built with Intel C++, 
which IIUC has a different C++ ABI than GCC on windows.

To use MinGW, you will need to build the library from the source 
package.  This requires you to run configure, so you will need either 
MSys or cygwin (something to provide the equiv of /bin/sh).


- MinGW GCC 3.4.5 will work fine (we use 3.4.4 to build our Linux binary 
pacakges).  GCC 4.1/4.2 will give better performance, but that is 
another matter ...


- The compile error you're seeing is a result of the library not being 
able to find a FFT backend.  This happens because you're missing some 
macro definitions that need to be on the command line.

If you look in the file 'lib/pkgconfig/vsipl++.pc' of the binary 
package, you will see a line:

cppflags=-I${includedir}  -DVSIP_IMPL_PAR_SERVICE=0 
-DVSIP_IMPL_IPP_FFT=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_FLOAT=1 
-DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_DOUBLE=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_LONG_DOUBLE=1 
-DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_FLOAT=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_DOUBLE=1 
-DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_LONG_DOUBLE=0 -DVSIP_IMPL_USE_CBLAS=2

These macros tell the library which FFT backends to use (in this case, 
we're using the IPP FFT, which happens to be how the windows binary 
package was configured).

Those definitions need to be on the command line when you compile.

You might retry compiling fft.cpp as

g++ -c -I/usr/local/include -DVSIP_IMPL_PAR_SERVICE=0 
-DVSIP_IMPL_IPP_FFT=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_FLOAT=1 
-DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_DOUBLE=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_FFT_USE_LONG_DOUBLE=1 
-DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_FLOAT=1 -DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_DOUBLE=1 
-DVSIP_IMPL_PROVIDE_FFT_LONG_DOUBLE=0 -DVSIP_IMPL_USE_CBLAS=2

That should fix the compilation errors.  However, the above mentioned 
problem of ICC and MinGW C++ ABI's being incompatible still remains of 
course!

- Sourcery VSIPL++ can be built with Cygwin too.


Do you have MSYS installed along with MinGW?  If so, you should 
configure the library from the source package.  The following configure 
command would be a good starting point:

	configure				\
		--with-lapack=simple-builtin	\
		--enable-fft=builtin

Let us know how that works!

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> g++ -c -I/usr/local/include fft.cpp

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's when the error occurred. I did not configure the fft backends or anything else. Nor did I expect the link step to work because there are no .a libraries in the Windows binary.
