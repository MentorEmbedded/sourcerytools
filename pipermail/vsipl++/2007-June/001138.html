At first I tried to build the source distribution using MinGW and g++ 3.4.5, but the build failed trying to configure ATLAS and I was not able to produce the config files.
 
So then I tried using the IA32 binary, just to see if I could compile the example fft.cpp (and the BeamformEx files) from the MS-DOS command line:
 
&gt;<i> g++ -c -I/usr/local/include fft.cpp
</I> 
That's when the error occurred. I did not configure the fft backends or anything else. Nor did I expect the link step to work because there are no .a libraries in the Windows binary. 
 
I suppose I will have to set up a Cygwin environment, but I was hoping that MinGW alone would work.
 
Tnx,
John Day

You are right, the problem is related to the dispatch mechanism we use to
delegate calls to backends. In this case, it sounds as if you haven't
configured any fft backends.
You mention the windows binary release, which is configured / compiled
for use with Intel's IPP and MKL libraries. But then you are talking about
the source distribution, and mingw. To help you a little further it
is important to know what Sourcery VSIPL++ package you use, and how exactly
the command looks that raises the error. Are you configuring / building
Sourcery VSIPL++ yourself ? What commands are you using ?

Thanks,
                Stefan
