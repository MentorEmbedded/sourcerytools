Right, configuring ATLAS is not easy. We have never attempted to support ATLAS
on Windows. Note, however, that there are a number of configure options to work
around those problems by using alternate lapack implementations, or none at all
(thus disabling parts of the functionality provided by the VSIPL++ spec). You
can find out more about these in the quickstart
(<A HREF="http://www.codesourcery.com/public/vsiplplusplus/sourceryvsipl++-1.3/quickstart/ch02s03.html">http://www.codesourcery.com/public/vsiplplusplus/sourceryvsipl++-1.3/quickstart/ch02s03.html</A>)

&gt;<i> So then I tried using the IA32 binary, just to see if I could compile the example fft.cpp (and the BeamformEx files) from the MS-DOS command line:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> g++ -c -I/usr/local/include fft.cpp
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> That's when the error occurred. I did not configure the fft backends or anything else. Nor did I expect the link step to work because there are no .a libraries in the Windows binary. 
</I>
That is strange, as the Windows binary package is configured / built
for use with Intel's IPP and MKL. I'm thus not sure what causes the
error message you are reporting. Please note that the suggested way
to build applications with Sourcery VSIPL++ is to query compiler options
from the vsipl++.pc files that are part of binary releases. It is possible,
or even likely, that you are missing some important macro definition that
causes the built-in FFT backends to be masked.

&gt;<i> I suppose I will have to set up a Cygwin environment, but I was hoping that MinGW alone would work.
</I>
The only supported compiler on Windows is Intel's ICC. We haven't attempted
to build using GCC on Windows, though we are now considering it.

Regards,
