Subject: Reading individual variables from .mat file
Message-ID: <442f3f200907241358x75eb1587g3594a97f5c7ce1c5@mail.gmail.com>

I have a Matlab .mat file and am attempting to read multiple variables (or
specify individual variables from a file containing multiple variables).
However, using the examples under "Matlab IO" documentation I am only able
to retrieve one variable (always the same one).  Any ideas?

Also, when attempting to use the 'iterator interface' example in the
documentation, I get the following error...

erminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  Matlab_view_header(read): Unsupported data_element type: got
miCOMPRESSED (15), can only handl miMATRIX (14)

Thanks

Perhaps a better example to follow for Matlab IO with multiple variables
in a single file is the example in the testsuite, contained in
tests/vsip_csl/matlab/matlab_bin_file/matlab_bin_file.cpp.  For
reference, I've attached a copy.

When you first use operator>> on your std::ifstream object with a
Matlab_bin_formatter object, you will always retrieve the first variable
in the file.  If you then use it again on the same std::ifstream object
(without closing and reopening the file), you'll get the second
variable, and so forth.  The "name" argument is not used to locate the
variable within the file -- its purpose was only as a check to make sure
that the loaded variable corresponds to the programmer's expectations.

Unfortunately, there are some known bugs with the Matlab-file iterator
interface, and it is currently not working.
