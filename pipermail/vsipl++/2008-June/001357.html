Yes, that's the one. :-)

One issue that so far I have only been able to work around by somewhere 
injecting &quot;#include &lt;vsip/parallel.hpp&gt;&quot; was that some 
(expression-)block types use a Local_or_global_map, which derives from 
Global_map, which comes from parallel/*.
And unless all relevant templates (traits, etc.) are seen by the 
compiler, some operations may raise a compilation-error pointing out 
that it's invalid to mix local and global blocks in assignments...

&gt;&gt;<i> * There are sets of templates that form a self-contained block of

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I completely agree too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll take an action to add some documentation for Combine_return_type.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You'll notice I did add some gratuitous documentation to one of

</I>&gt;<i> back into the library (relearning what we've written before but didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> document), to add some documentation.
</I>
Yes ! (I have a list of topics that I want to document myself, so I'm 
happy to wrap that up, too.)

Thanks,
		Stefan
