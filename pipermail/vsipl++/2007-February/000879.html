That's a good question. I believe our FFT frontends don't yet provide copy-construction
and assignment. The plan is to allow multiple FFT frontends to share a single
backend. In any case, we should definitely put an operator= declaration somewhere,
if only into the private section to make it clear that this type is non-assignable.

</I>
Right, we can't check alignment in the evaluator as that doesn't see the block
objects passed to operator(). Thus, the only place to actually handle it is
by means of ext_data in the workspace.

Regards,
