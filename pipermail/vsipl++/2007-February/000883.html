I think this is the right thing to do.
Jules, we quickly talked about this in the past: should we make the implicit
memory allocation used by Dense&lt;&gt; (i.e. when not using user-storage) use
alloc_align&lt;&gt; instead of 'new' ?

&gt;&gt;<i> [8] Do we really have a real-&gt;complex FFT on the SPE?

</I>&gt;<i> No, but we could implement these variations fairly easily by putting in

</I>
Are you referring to dispatching a real FFT to complex FFT ? I don't think
this is a good idea. Doing a real FFT should be substantially faster than
a complex FFT, and take much less memory.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, I don't see how you could check for unit-stride here since there

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dispatch a bit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was looking at the serial expression dispatch code, which of course is
</I>&gt;<i> different.  I'd like to understand how this is handled in the FFT code
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>
Data layout is checked in the operator() implementation(s). Have a look at
vsip/opt/workspace.hpp:97. We assume unit-stride is supported by all backends,
so we have a 'fast path' for it.
In other cases we first need to query the backend whether it supports the
given layout, by calling backend-&gt;query_layout(), passing in the actual
layout, and getting back a modified layout that would be accepted.
Based on this we construct an 'Rt_ext_data' object that will make the
necessary adjustments (i.e. possibly do a copy internally).

So, as a backend implementer, you should look at the default implementation
in vsip/core/fft/backend.hpp:51, possibly overriding this from the cbe backends.

&gt;<i> Although this did remind me that we are not passing any flags to the SPU
</I>&gt;<i> compiler like -Wall.  I changed this to do the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    CC_SPU_FLAGS := @CXXFLAGS@
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which passes any PPU flags from the configure line on to the SPU
</I>&gt;<i> compiler.  Is this ok, at least for now?
</I>
This should be

CC_SPU_FLAGS := @CFLAGS@,

since CXXFLAGS may contain C++-specific flags that are not valid when compiling
C. In the long run we should think of setting CC_SPU_FLAGS from within configure.ac,
the same way CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are set, so we can predefine the variable, and then
only add to that, instead of overwriting it.

Thanks,
		Stefan
