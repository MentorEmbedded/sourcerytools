That sounds fine.




&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The example set that cause this error results from leaving the imaginary

</I>&gt;<i> all ones.  Doing this results in outputs where the imaginary portion is

</I>&gt;<i> order of 1e-6, which are only a few bits off of zero (for floats) but 
</I>&gt;<i> will fail the current comparison check.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, this is a separate topic and I don't think it affects

</I>
That is fine.  In the future, we may want to use 'error_db' to compare 
the results.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One other item is worth bringing up though.  There was an error in the 
</I>&gt;<i> previous patch for the not-from-file case where the output (now 
</I>&gt;<i> 'expected') vectors were not seeded with the correct answers.  I believe 
</I>&gt;<i> I let this one in by failing to compile and test in debug mode.  Given 
</I>&gt;<i> that assert() does nothing in optimized builds, the data checks will not 
</I>&gt;<i> be run the way the benchmark will normally be configured.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps it would be nice to insert something that printed a nice warning 
</I>&gt;<i> if the call to view_equal() fails, then passes the result to assert() 
</I>&gt;<i> which will halt execution in the debug case (handy) but allow it to 
</I>&gt;<i> continue in the optimized case (ok since warning printed?).  Better 
</I>&gt;<i> warnings could be printed from within the view_equal() function, e.g. 
</I>&gt;<i> ones that show the location of the error and the values that failed 
</I>&gt;<i> comparison.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, perhaps we always want to check the data.  It is done 
</I>&gt;<i> outside the timing loop, so doesn't affect results, but it does slow the 
</I>&gt;<i> overall execution time.  Suggestions?
</I>
Is 'test_assert()' officially available for the benchmarks?  It is not 
disabled by -DNDEBUG.  I started using it in the benchmarks of the 
regular 'assert()' for that reason.

For view_equal, we could add a 'verbose' flag that would cause an error 
message to be printed if a miscompare is detected.  view_equal() would 
still return true/false, so it could be used in an assert() or 
test_assert().



&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok to check in with these changes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes, these look good.  Please check them in.

			thanks,
