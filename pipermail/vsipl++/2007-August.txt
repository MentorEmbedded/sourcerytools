Subject: next release?
Message-ID: <BAY144-DAV657FBD6D2CE9D7D9E25F5B5EB0@phx.gbl>

I note that previous releases came at ~ 4 month intervals. v1.3 was out in 
February.

Any public plans for the next release bringing together recent fixes and 
improvements?

Paul

Subject: [patch] SAL long/short -> float conversions
Message-ID: <46C9FE72.8060103@codesourcery.com>

This patch adds dispatch to some SAL conversions.

It disables the matrix copy/transpose evaluator from catching 
non-transpose conversions so that the dense and mdim evaluators can 
redispatch them.

It also passes vector and matrix fills (view = constant) through 
dispatch.  Right now this gets handled by SIMD evaluator, but in the 
future we add fast/vendor dispatch.

Patch applied.

Subject: [patch] Fix SIMD evaluator buglet
Message-ID: <46CB0945.4000903@codesourcery.com>

The SIMD ct_valid check for unary expressions was slightly broken.  This 
was causing Ext_data to be used for blocks with a non-zero cost in the 
vmmul test, resulting in a failure.  This only turned up recently with 
the Expr_mdim evaluator sending more work through dispatch.

Patch applied.
