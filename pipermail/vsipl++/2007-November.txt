Subject: [patch] Separable filter
Message-ID: <472F239F.7020804@codesourcery.com>

This patch implements a subset of separable filter functionality, along 
with a unit test and a benchmark.

Overall, this follows our image processing API draft:

https://intranet.codesourcery.com/VSIPLImageProcessing

This is in the vsip_csl::img namespace.

I also added a new support type: support_min_zeropad.  It computes the 
same support as support_min, however it produces an image the same size 
as the input, zero-filling outputs not computed (i.e. zero-padding the 
image border).

This support type matches how the registration code uses its separable 
filter.  It also matches with IPP's separable filter implementation.

Such a support type would also let us extend Convolution to use SAL's 
f3x3 and f5x5 functions, which essentially compute a min-support result 
with zero-padding around the edges.

On verona, performance is poor with the generic BE (260 MF/s at 
1024x1024 image with 7x7 filter) and very good with the IPP BE (8413 MF/s).

Ok to apply?

Subject: Live Webcast: Cell Broadband Engine by IBM and CodeSourcery
Message-ID: <4734F341.2090401@codesourcery.com>

Attached is an announcement about a joint presentation by IBM and
CodeSourcery regarding the Cell Broadband Engine and some of the signal-
and image-processing library development that CodeSourcery is doing for
the Cell/B.E.  This presentation will take place on November 15th, at
2PM EST/11AM PST.

Max Aguilar, an IBM Master Inventor, will be explaining some of the key
aspects of the Cell/B.E. hardware platform.  I will talk about Sourcery
VSIPL++ for the Cell/B.E., as well as two lower-level programming
interfaces that will also be useful to developers of high-performance
signal and image-processing programs.

If you want to sign up for the e-Cast, visit:

I hope you can join us!

Subject: [1.3] Mem Leak in vsip::llsqsol?
Message-ID: <A6F917AB-E21D-4EB2-8575-C067B0D985D3@ll.mit.edu>

Hi,

I'm got what appears to be a memory problem with vsip::llsqsol 
( Matrix, Matrix ). If I comment out my call, then the memory remains  
constant. Any known problems with 1.3 and this routine? Any hints on  
how to work around it? I've got another solution using vsip::svd, but  
it has its own problems right now.

Thanks,

Brad

Brad,

Unfortunately we weren't aware of this memory leak (and hence don't have 
an immediate work around to suggest).  However, I'm sure we can either 
fix it or find a work around.

A couple of questions:

What version of VSIPL++ are you using?

What backend library are you using for linear algebra?  I.e. ATLAS, MKL, 
SAL, C-VSIPL?

Also, what problems are you encountering with SVD?
	
				thanks,

Brad,

I have a fix for your problem!  Since you are building from source, it
should be easy to apply the fix using the command

    patch -p0 < temp_buffer.diff

issued from the top-level directory (the one containing 'src'), or by
editing the file in question manually.

Please let me know if this works for you and thanks again for letting us
know about the problem!


Team,

I tested this patch against Sourcery VSIPL++ v1.3 under x86 Linux, but
it should be applicable to all build variations and all branches.  Ok to
commit?
