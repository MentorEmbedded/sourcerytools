&gt; laptop computer.
&gt;  
&gt; 2) Also, I installed the Intel(R) C++ Compiler for 32-bit applications,
&gt; Version 9.1 (evaluation copy) on my laptop computer.
&gt;  
&gt; 3) I unzipped the VSIPL++ binary package.
&gt;  
&gt; 4) I tried to compile and run /share/sourceryvsipl++/example1.cpp
&gt; *without success.*

The Makefile in that directory assumes a UNIX-like environment with
tools such as pkg-config to extract build parameters from pre-built
and packaged configuration files. Unfortunately, that strategy isn't
supported on Windows, where these tools don't exist.

Instead, it is assumed that you use some platform-specific build
environment (such as the MSVC IDE), where you manually add build
parameters, such as installation paths for third-party libraries
that are used in conjunction with Sourcery VSIPL++.

We are working on ways to enhance this for future releases.

&gt; Please look at the following compilation output and tell me what's wrong.
&gt;  
&gt; The last error showed the header file, mkl_cblas.h, was not found.
&gt; The *VSIPL++ binary package does not contain mkl_cblas.h*. Should I go
&gt; somewhere else to get this missing header file?

The Windows version of Sourcery VSIPL++ is built using Intel's
IPP and MKL libraries (see
http://www.codesourcery.com/public/vsiplplusplus/sourceryvsipl++-1.2/quickstart/chap-installation.html#id287819
for more information on these).
We are looking into how to remove that restriction, i.e. to make IPP and MKL
optional, like they are on other platforms.

Regards,
		Stefan
