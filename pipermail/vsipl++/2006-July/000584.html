Don, this looks good, please check it in. thanks -- Jules

The reason this is OK is that the $(LIBS) variable (which is used in the 
rule) has the effect of including the .a files from $(libs) (which is 
used in the dependency.

For example, if you are linking against the built-in fftw3, then

    LIBS will have -lfftw3f, and
    libs will have lib/fftw3f.a

the compile command will have '-Llib -lfftw3f', causing it to use 
lib/fftw3f.a from the dependency.

I suppose we could simplify by using $(libs) in both the dependency and 
the command, but we would still have to build $(LIBS) for external use 
(it goes into the .pc) file, and $(LIBS) may have other external 
libraries, meaning we would end up using $(libs) and $(LIBS_NOT_IN_libs) :)
