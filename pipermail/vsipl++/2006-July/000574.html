 &gt;&gt; Also, we should start thinking about how this should be configured
 &gt;&gt; and controlled.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt; I like the configuration suggestions so far, but would like to put the
 &gt; one below off until we have the basic stuff implemented first.

Sounds good.

 &gt; For the
 &gt; record though, I see only a very minor benefit to being able to
 &gt; selectively turn these on and off.

OK.  I tried to avoid going overboard with the categories.  I think
the three things that will be most useful:

  - Turn off expression profiling, expressions will be more numerous
    than the other events, so this may allow longer traces to be
    collected.
  - Turn on communication profiling but disable everything else, this
    way compute times aren't too perturbed by the profiling.
  - Turn off library profiling but leave user events on.

 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;  - What types of events are profiled (by broad categories).
 &gt;&gt;    Categories:
 &gt;&gt;     - objects: signal processing objects and linear algebra solvers
 &gt;&gt;     - matvec: linear algebra
 &gt;&gt;     - expr: element-wise expressions
 &gt;&gt;     - comm: communications
 &gt;&gt;     - user events
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;    New option: --with-profile-cat={no,objects,matvec,expr,user,all}
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;    Default is {no}.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;  - Whether performance API (impl_performance) is enabled:
 &gt;&gt;    New option --[enable,disable]-performance-api
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt; Same here, the fewer options, the better...
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;     --vsipl++-profile-mode={accum,trace,off}
 &gt;&gt;     --vsipl++-profile-output={filename}
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;    Probably most useful for tracing very small programs and accumulating
 &gt;&gt;    larger programs.
 &gt;
 &gt; Ok.  Some benefit here.  Sounds like you're already willing to put this
 &gt; off as a future enhancement.

Yes, low priority for this one.

 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;  &gt; # mode: pm_accum
 &gt;&gt;  &gt; # timer: x86_64_tsc_time
 &gt;&gt;  &gt; # clocks_per_sec: 3591371008
 &gt;&gt;  &gt; #
 &gt;&gt;  &gt; # tag : total ticks : num calls : op count : mflops
 &gt;&gt;  &gt; fwd fft, cplx-cplx, rbv : 102141 : 1 : 51200 : 1800.24
 &gt;&gt;  &gt; inv fft, cplx-cplx, rbv : 95490 : 1 : 51200 : 1925.63
 &gt;&gt;  &gt;
 &gt;&gt;  &gt; Note: rbv = return by value.  The others should be readable.  Full
 &gt;&gt;  &gt; documentation will follow soon.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Can you add the FFT size to the tag?
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt; I was going to propose adding a second 'value' field.  We had one that
 &gt; we kind of took over for the op count.  Why not just add one or two more
 &gt; fields and make them general-purpose?  FFTM could put rows and cols,
 &gt; etc.  Other routines could put whatever was most relevant...

Putting the size in another field will hurt the utility of the
accumulate mode.  It will be interesting not only to see how many
total FFTs a program performs, but also how many FFTs of a given size
are performed.  Operations of different sizes will have different
performance.  Aggregating them together will lose this.

For example, if someone was designing an FPGA for a specific VSIPL++
program to offload FFTs, they would be interested in what size FFTs
are being performed, and how efficiently those are on the processor.

 &gt; In any case, I don't want to add it to the tag because it is a useful
 &gt; numerical value, so we should give it first-class status so a
 &gt; post-processing program can access it more easily.

Making the size part of the name will not make it more difficult to
post process.  In languages like python and perl it is easy to
post-process textual output like this, using the delimiters to
separate different fields and regular-expressions to extract
information from tags (including size).  Here's how we might
post-process this in perl:

	while ($line = &lt;FILE&gt;) {
	   $line =~ s/\s+//g;	# get rid of spaces
	   my ($tag, $ticks, $calls, $opcount, $mflops) = split(':', $line);

	   # Process the tag
	   if ($tag =~ /^(fwd|inv)fft,(cplx|real)-(cplx|real),(rbv|rbr),(\d+)$/) {
	      # 1-D FFT
	      $dim       = 1;
	      $dir       = $1;
	      $from_type = $2;
	      $to_type   = $3;
	      $returnby  = $4;
	      $size[0]   = $5;
	      }
	   elsif ($tag =~ 
/^(fwd|inv)fft,(cplx|real)-(cplx|real),(rbv|rbr),(\d+),(\d+)$/) {
	      # 2-D FFT
	      $dim       = 2;
	      $dir       = $1;
	      $from_type = $2;
	      $to_type   = $3;
	      $returnby  = $4;
	      $size[0]   = $5;
	      $size[1]   = $6;
	      }
	   }
	   ...
	}

 &gt; Plus, I wanted to
 &gt; keep the tags as short as possible as we use them for searching (maybe
 &gt; this doesn't matter so much though).

&quot;searching&quot; in the context of using them as keys for the std::map?

 &gt; I also considered removing the
 &gt; spaces and making it more compact, yet more cryptic.  What's the right
 &gt; balance here between short-and-cryptic and long-but-readable?

I don't think that removing the spaces will make the tags more
cryptic.  When trying to visually read a trace file, the biggest
impediments will be little things like if the columns don't line up,
if the lines wrap, or if the numbers aren't left-aligned.  However,
those are things that will be easy to fix in post processing.

The current scheme seems to be about the right level of conciseness,
perhaps a little on the verbose side for some things.  Things like
'fwd' and 'fft' are right on.  'cplx' is a little verbose IMHO, also
how do we distinguish between float and double?  We could use the
BLAS/LAPACK convention of S - float, C - complex&lt;float&gt;, D - double,
and Z - complex&lt;double&gt;.

 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt; Does base_interface have enough context to figure out the event name
 &gt;&gt; by itself?  If not, it might be worth passing the extra info (i.e.
 &gt;&gt; adding a template parameter for by_value vs by_reference).  That would
 &gt;&gt; make it easier to limit the impact of the profiling when it is turned
 &gt;&gt; off.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt; I'll look at this again, that may be the case.  But I'm not sure how it
 &gt; affects performance.  Can you explain?  Can we afford the slight
 &gt; increase in cost for this since it is taking place when the Fft object
 &gt; is constructed?

There are two issues here.  First, limiting the footprint of the
profiling code so that it is easier to understand and maintain.  If we
have enough information to put the name creation in a single place
(such as base_interface) versus repeated in multiple places (all of
the FFT objects that derive from base_interface), it makes it easier
to maintain later (as a general rule, avoiding repetition is a good
thing).  Putting the name creation together with the construction of
the Profile_event object that uses the name also improves the
&quot;locality&quot; of the code, making it easier to understand.

Second, from a performance standpoint, reducing the footprint also
makes it easier to excise the profiling via #if/#endif if either the
overhead or other requirements (such as the need to iostream includes)
ever become problematic.

 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Profile_event should keep track of its accumulated time.  The above
 &gt;&gt; approach has two problems:
 &gt;&gt;  - Profile_event (and hence impl_performance) will only work when
 &gt;&gt;    profiling is turned on in the pm_accum mode.
 &gt;&gt;  - Objects with the same tag will confound each other's impl_performance
 &gt;&gt;    results.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt; Both can be perceived as benefits -- at least I viewed them that way!
 &gt;
 &gt; My argument would be that it should not do any profiling, or at least
 &gt; should minimize the effects of the profiling code, when profiling is not
 &gt; enabled.

That is the intent of the configuration flag for the performance API.

 &gt; Secondly, having the same underlying interface to both is good
 &gt; because it is simpler.

It is good to be pragmatic about simplicity, but at the same time we
don't want to create something that is difficult or unintuitive to
use.

 &gt; Finally, objects having the same tag are doing
 &gt; the same kind of work.  If however, the user desires, they may profile
 &gt; each separately by using different log files, or (if in the same scope)
 &gt; using the profiler in trace mode.

Objects of different sizes are going to have different performance
characteristics.  Even if size is included in the tag name, there is
still utility in the impl_performance interface's ability to collect
the performance of a specific object.  The ability to isolate
performance information to smaller and smaller contexts is important
for zeroing in on performance problems.  Of course the trace mode
offers the ultimate in zeroing in, but the impl_performance is a
intermediate step between accumulate and trace.

There are two concerns at play here: What functionality will users
need to optimize the performance of their programs, and how should we
implement that performance in a clean and intuitive way?

Unfortunately we won't really know what users need to profile their
programs until they try out what we have and give us feedback.  We can
make guesses based on requests (AFRL asked for approximately the
impl_performance interface, LM asked for a impl_performance on
steroids that collects min/max/histogram -- which might really be done
by post processing trace output) and our own experience.  Ultimately
there may not be a single set of things that work for everyone.  We'll
probably end up expanding the profiling in response to user requests
to do things like trace a single object, etc

For now, I think the best approach is to define a simple, well defined
set of tools that users can pick and choose from to fit their own
needs.

Having something that is well-defined and intuitive is important.  For
impl_performance, because it is a member function of an individual
signal processing object, it will be surprising if it returns
information that is aggregated from other objects.  Side-effects from
external events, such as turning profiling on and off, or changing
from accumulate to trace, may also be unintuitive.

 &gt; I'm not overtly attached to the above implementation.  Either way is
 &gt; good, and now is a good time to decide.  Maybe I've missed something
 &gt; about how you see impl_performance() being used that I don't.  I'm
 &gt; looking at it as a different interface into the same basic set of
 &gt; profiling features.  Do others have thoughts on this?
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks for the feedback!

Thanks, this is coming along well!
