Mark,

I need to look at my usage of serial vs parallel before committing to 
this.  I'm sure there are some cases where it would be more clear to say 
&quot;uni-processor&quot; and &quot;multi-processor&quot; instead.  However, in contexts 
where &quot;parallel&quot; refers to data-parallelism may be exploited in multiple 
ways (multiple processors doing FFTs in parallel, single processor doing 
multiple FFTs in parallel with SIMD, etc), that might be the most 
appropriate word.

As I edit this to clean up the first-person, I'll take a look at how 
parallel/serial is used.

</I>
That is a source of potential confusion, especially with MPI; nodes, 
processors, thread, and now cores.

The VSIPL++ spec has an intentionally vague definition of a &quot;processor&quot; 
that we can fall back on here.  The mapping from a VSIPL++ processor to 
actual hardware parallelism is up to the implementation.  The intent is 
that VSIPL++ processes represent parallelism that could be exploited by 
MPI processes, threads, etc.  If we did use the term &quot;multi-processor&quot; 
in the VSIPL++ tutorial it would be well-defined in that sense.

Of course, if you guys have come up with more clear wording, we'd be 
interested!

Not at all!  That's why the list is public.  Its good to hear from you.
