Subject: vsipl++ installation on Cell
Message-ID: <4299.130.70.83.124.1250651189.squirrel@webmail.cacs.louisiana.edu>

Hello,

I'm not sure is this the right place to ask about installation problem. 
If not, please help direct me to any forum/mailing list that can help.

I am installing VSIPL++ on Cell QS22, Fedora core 9, using the source code
downloaded from
http://www.codesourcery.com/vsiplplusplus/2.1/download.html
(sourceryvsipl++-lite-2.1-5-source.tar.bz2) for academic project.

I follow the installation step in "getting start" document.

1) I have installed ppu-gcc.ppc, ppu-gcc-c++.ppc, ppu-binutils.ppc,
libspe2.ppc64, libspe2-devel.ppc64, atlas.ppc64, and atlas-devel.ppc64
using yum.

I guess my system is 64 bit, according to uname output.

uname -a
Linux ####### 2.6.25.14-108.20080910bsc.ppc64 #1 SMP Fri Sep 12 11:44:36
CEST 2008 ppc64 ppc64 ppc64 GNU/Linux

Some package (such as ppu-gcc, ppu-gcc-c++) does not have .ppc64, so I
install with .ppc.


2) I start to run simple configure, and make
./configure CC="ppu-cc" CXX="ppu-g++" --with-cbe-sdk --with-numa
make

It give me an error:
spu-gcc -c -fpic  -I src -I ./src -I ./src/vsip/opt/cbe -I
/usr/spu/include -I /opt/cell/sdk/usr/spu/include -O3 -o
src/vsip/opt/cbe/spu/plugin/chalfast_f.o
src/vsip/opt/cbe/spu/plugin/chalfast_f.c
src/vsip/opt/cbe/spu/plugin/chalfast_f.c:21:17: error: cml.h: No such file
or directory

I have search all the source, it doesn't seems that cml.h exist anywhere.

3) According to the document, Atlas is required in Cell platform, so I go
with:
./configure CC="ppu-cc" CXX="ppu-g++" --with-cbe-sdk --with-numa
--with-lapack=atlas --with-atlas-libdir=/usr/lib64/atlas/
--with-atlas-include=/usr/include/atlas/

which cannot found Atlas installation and give me an error:
Searching for LAPACK packages: atlas
checking for LAPACK/ATLAS library (atlas w/CBLAS)... not found
configure: error: LAPACK enabled but no library found

I have check /usr/include/atlas and /usr/lib64/atlas, there are .h, .a,
and .so as it should be.  What else should I check here ?  What exactly
file/library that VSIPL++ looking for.

4) I have tried --enable-timer=power_tb, got this error

checking if PowerPC timebase assembly syntax supported.... configure:
error: GNU in-line assembly for PowerPC timebase not supported.

Any package recommend ?

5) As document said that there is bug of Altivec on 64 bit machine. I have
try --disable-fftw3-simd, but that doesn't help.


Thank you in advance,
Itthichok Jangjaimon

Hello,

Yes, this is the correct place to ask for help.  Thank you for
contacting us!

The GPL "Lite" version of Sourcery VSIPL++ does not include the Cell
Math Library (CML), which is required in order to use the SPUs on Cell
processors.  This is the source of the missing cml.h file, as that is
the header file for CML.  I apologize that this was not clearer in the
documentation, since CML is included in the full version of Sourcery
VSIPL++ for Cell processors.

We do offer academic pricing for Sourcery VSIPL++ including the Cell
Math Library, if you are interested.  Contact sales at codesourcery.com for
details.

Alternately, you can compile the GPL version of Sourcery VSIPL++ without
the --with-cbe-sdk configure option, which will produce a version that
works on your QS22 but only uses the PPU part of the processor.  Your
ATLAS installation looks correct, so something else (perhaps the missing
CML) may be confusing the configure script; you can look at the
config.log file to see the exact compile error that resulted in this
error message.  I suspect a similar problem is happening with the timer
as well.

Regards,
- Brooks
