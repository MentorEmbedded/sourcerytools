Subject: Sourcery VSIPL++ 2.1 Available
Message-ID: <4A147B61.6030303@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery is pleased to announce the availability of Sourcery VSIPL
2.1, Sourcery VSIPL++ 2.1, and Sourcery VSIPL++ 2.1 Lite.
The main features include improved support for IBM Cell/B.E. (building 
with SDK 3.1 is now supported, as is building with only the GNU CBE 
toolchain), improvements to Cell/B.E. performance, and an early 
technology preview of Sourcery VSIPL++ for GPU/CUDA.

Sourcery VSIPL++ and Sourcery VSIPL are full implementations of the
VSIPL++ and VSIPL APIs, respectively, open standards for
platform-independent signal and image-processing developed by the DOD
High Performance Embedded Computing Software Initiative (HPEC-SI) and
the VSIPL Forum. Both provide many high-level routines used in SIP
computing, such as FFTs, FIR filters, SVD and QR decomposition, and
linear algebra. Sourcery VSIPL++ offers the added benefits of greater
productivity and performance through C++'s high-level syntax, and
support for multiple processor systems.
