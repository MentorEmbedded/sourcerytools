profiling.

Don,

This looks good.

I originally envisioned this to be primarily the event descriptions in
section 5 (&quot;Event Tags&quot;) that would be fluctuating around enough that a
text file is the best place to keep them.

However, the additional material looks good.  It just increases the
pressure to get it into (soon to be created) reference section of
the user's guide!

I have some suggestions below.  I think the document looks good overall,
once you're happy, please check it in as a text file.

In the meantime, I will rename the &quot;Tutorial&quot; document to be a &quot;User's
Guide&quot; with tutorial and reference sections.  When this is done, you can
create a chapter with the stable bits from this document.

 &gt; +3) Profiling Functions
 &gt; +4) Profile Log Files
 &gt; +5) Event Tags
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +1) Compiling with Profiling Enabled

I would call this section &quot;Configure and Compile Options for Profiling&quot;
or just &quot;Configure and COmpile Options&quot; (since this is profiling reference
chapter).

 &gt; 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;There are no configure options for profiling, instead it is enabled
via compile-time options.  However, to use profiling it is necessary
to configure the library with a suitable high-resolution timer (cross
reference to '--enable_timer' option in quickstart).  For example,&quot;

 &gt; +If building from source, enable a suitable high-resolution timer
 &gt; +when configuring the library.  For example,
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  --enable-timer=x86_64_tsc
 &gt; +
 &gt; +Pre-built versions of the library enable a suitable timer for your
 &gt; +system.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +To enable profiling, define VSIP_IMPL_PROFILER=&lt;mask&gt; on the command
 &gt; +line when compiling your program.  On many systems, this option may be
 &gt; +added to the CXXFLAGS variable in the project makefile.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +This macro enables profiling operations in several different areas
 &gt; +of the library, depending on the value of &lt;mask&gt;
 &gt; +
 &gt; +	  Profiling Configuration Mask
 &gt; +
 &gt; +	Section	Description		Value
 &gt; +        -------------------------------------
 &gt; +	signal	Signal Processing         1	
 &gt; +	matvec	Linear Algbra		  2
 &gt; +	fns	Elementwise Functions	  4
 &gt; +	user	User-defined Operations	  8
 &gt; +
 &gt; +Determine the mask value by summing the values listed in the table
 &gt; +for the areas you wish to profile.  For example, if you wish to
 &gt; +gather performance data on your own code as well as for FFT's,
 &gt; +you would enable 'user' and 'signal' from the table above.  The
 &gt; +value you would choose would be 1 + 8 = 9.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +2) Command Line Options
 &gt; 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would emphasize that this is contigent on enabling profiling when 
compiling.

&quot;For programs that have been compiled with profiling enabled, the profiling
mode and output file can be controlled from the command line.&quot;

 &gt; +You may profile programs without inserting any code by specifying the
 &gt; +options on the command line.  Use this to choose the profiler mode:
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  --vsipl++-profile-mode={accum, trace}
 &gt; +

These paragraphs on trace and accumulate mode could go into a separate
section &quot;Profiling Modes&quot;, or into the section on the log file format.
This point in the file is the first point they are used so it is the
logical place to define them, but since this is reference text, it may
not be used in a linear fashion.  I.e. If a user may want to refresh
their memory on what the modes are (&quot;what are the profilign modes
again?&quot;), it would not be readily apparant from the table of contents
that their definitions are in this section.

 &gt; +In 'trace' mode, the start and stop times where events begin and end
 &gt; +are stored as profile data.  The log will present these events in
 &gt; +chronological order.  This mode is preferred when a highly detailed
 &gt; +view of program execution is desired.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +In 'accumulate' mode, the start and stop times are subtracted to
 &gt; +compute the duration of an event and the cumulative sum of these
 &gt; +durations are stored as profile data.  The log will indicate the
 &gt; +total amount of time spent in each event.  This mode is desirable
 &gt; +when investigating a specific function's average performance.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +Specify the path to the log file for profile output using:
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  --vsipl++-profile-output=/path/to/logfile
 &gt; +
 &gt; +The second option defaults to the standard output on most
 &gt; +systems, so it may be omitted.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +

 &gt; +3) Profiling Functions

These are all objects, so this should be &quot;Profiling Objects&quot;

 &gt; 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

It would be good to clarify that manually creating a Profile object
is an alternative to controlling profiling from the command line.

Maybe end the previous section with a transition paragraph:

&quot;The profiling command line options control profiling for the entire
program execution.  For finer grain control, such as enabling profiling
during a specific portion of the program, or to mix different profiling
modes, explicit Profiling objects can be created.&quot;

Also, I would mention the arguments (object creation) before mentioning
what happens when the object is destroyed:

&quot;The 'Profile' object is used to enable profiling during the lifetime
of the object.  When created, it takes arguments to indicate the
output file and the profiling mode (trace or accumulate).  When
destroyted (i.e. goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted),
the profile data is written to the specified output file.  For example:&quot;

 &gt; +The 'Profile' object is created to gather timing data for the
 &gt; +duration of its existence.   When it is destroyed (i.e. goes
 &gt; +out of scope or is explicitly deleted) the profile data is written
 &gt; +to the specified output file.  The first parameter specifies the
 &gt; +logfile and the second, the profiling mode.  For example:
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  impl::profile::Profile profile(&quot;profile.txt&quot;, impl::profile::accum)

Let's not overwrite this file with profiling output!

It would be good to clarify or hint that a user only needs to create
Scope_event objects for user-defined events.  The library already
defines a host of Scope_events for internal events.

 &gt; +
 &gt; +The 'Scope_event' object is used to insert a profiler event
 &gt; +into the log.

&quot;'Scope_event' is only necessary in user code for user-defined
events.&quot;


 &gt;  This object should be created at the point where
 &gt; +you wish to begin timing and destroyed when the event is over
 &gt; +(such as a computation).  For example:
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  impl::profile::Scope_event event(&quot;User Event&quot;, op_count);
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^

&quot;Event Tag&quot; would tie this to the use of 'tag' in the log file
description.

 &gt; +
 &gt; +The first parameter is the tag that will be used to display the
 &gt; +event's performance data in the log file.  The second parameter is
                                            ^
&quot;(Section 5 &quot;Event Tags&quot; describes the event tags used internally by
the library)&quot;

 &gt; +optional.  If used, 'op_count' should be an unsigned integer specifying
 &gt; +an estimate of the total number of operations (floating point or
 &gt; +otherwise) performed.  This is used by the profiler to compute
 &gt; +the rate of computation.  Without it, the profiler will still
 &gt; +yield useful timing data.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +Creating a Scope_event object on the stack is the easiest way
 &gt; +to control the region it will profile.  For example, from within
 &gt; +the body of a function (or the as the entire function), use
 &gt; +this to define a region of interest:
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  {
 &gt; +    impl::profile::Scope_event event(&quot;Main computation:&quot;);
 &gt; +
 &gt; +    // perform main computation
 &gt; +    //
 &gt; +      ...
 &gt; +  }
 &gt; +
 &gt; +The closing brace causes 'event' to go out of scope, logging
 &gt; +the amount of time spent doing the computation.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +4) Profile Log Files
 &gt; 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 &gt; +The profiler outputs a small header at the beginning of each log file.
 &gt; +The headers differ slighly for acculate mode and trace modes.

4a) Log file header

	# mode: pm_accum
	# timer: x86_64_tsc_time
	# clocks_per_sec: 3591375104

The log file header has separate lines that describe:
  - the profiling mode used,
  - the low-level timer used to measure clock ticks,
  - the number of clock ticks per second,

 &gt; +
 &gt; +4a) Accumulate mode
 &gt; +
 &gt; +# mode: pm_accum
 &gt; +# timer: x86_64_tsc_time
 &gt; +# clocks_per_sec: 3591375104
 &gt; +#
 &gt; +# tag : total ticks : num calls : op count : mops
 &gt; +
 &gt; +The respective columns that follow this header are:
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  tag		A descriptive name of the operation.  This is either
 &gt; +		a name used internally or specified by the user.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  total ticks	The duration of the event in processor ticks.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  num calls	The number of times the event occurred.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  op count	The number of operations performed per event.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  mops		The calculated performance figure in millions
 &gt; +		of operations per second.

You could describe how mops is computed:


                    num_calls * op_count
                   ----------------------
                            10^6
    mops =      ----------------------------
                        total_ticks
                      ----------------
                       clocks_per_sec

 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +4b) Trace mode
 &gt; +
 &gt; +# mode: pm_trace
 &gt; +# timer: x86_64_tsc_time
 &gt; +# clocks_per_sec: 3591375104
 &gt; +#
 &gt; +# index : tag : ticks : open id : op count
 &gt; +
 &gt; +The respective columns that follow this header are:
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  index 	The entry number, beginning at one.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  tag		A descriptive name of the operation.  This is either
 &gt; +		a name used internally or specified by the user.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  ticks		The current reading from the processor clock.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +  open id	A zero to indicate an event was created.
 &gt; +		An event index to indicated the end of an event.

                 &quot;If zero, indicates the start of an event.
	        If non-zero, this indicates the end of an event and
	        refers to the index of corresponding start of the
	        event&quot;

 &gt; +
 &gt; +  op count	The number of operations performed per event, or
 &gt; +		zero to indicate the end of an event.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +Note that the timings expressed in 'ticks' may be converted to seconds
 &gt; +by dividing by the 'clocks_per_second' constant in the header.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +5) Event Tags
 &gt; 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 &gt; +Sourcery VSIPL++ uses the following tags for profiling objects/functions
 &gt; +within the library.  These tags are readable text containing information
 &gt; +that varies depending on the event, but generally it tells you:
                                                         ^^^^^^^^^
&quot;but generally it describes:&quot;

 &gt; +
 &gt; +  * The object/function name
 &gt; +  * The number of dimensions
 &gt; +  * Information about the data types involved
 &gt; +  * The size of each dimension
 &gt; +
 &gt; +In all cases, data types (&lt;T&gt;, &lt;I&gt; and &lt;O&gt; below) are expressed using
 &gt; +the BLAS/LAPACK convention of
 &gt; +
 &gt; +    S - float
 &gt; +    C - complex
 &gt; +    D - double
 &gt; +    Z - complex
 &gt; +
 &gt; +Expressions on views (vectors, matrices) are shown using prefix
 &gt; +notation, i.e.
 &gt; +
 &gt; +    operator(operand, ...)
 &gt; +
 &gt; +Each operand may be the result of another computation, so expressions
 &gt; +are nested, the parenthesis determining the order of evaluation.
 &gt; +When the operand types are views, the usual S/D/C/Z are used to
 &gt; +indicate the type.  When operands are scalars, lower-case values
 &gt; +are used instead (s/d/c/z).
 &gt; +
 &gt; +
 &gt; +Current Tag List:
 &gt; +
 &gt; +     --signal--
 &gt; +     Convolution [1D|2D] &lt;T&gt; &lt;row_size&gt;x&lt;col_size&gt;
 &gt; +     Correlation [1D|2D] &lt;T&gt; &lt;row_size&gt;x&lt;col_size&gt;
 &gt; +     Fft 1D [Inv|Fwd] &lt;I&gt;-&lt;O&gt; [by_ref|by_val] &lt;size&gt;x1

What about 2D and 3D Ffts?  Perhaps this should be:

         Fft [1D|2D|3D] [Inv|Fwd] &lt;I&gt;-&lt;O&gt; [by_ref|by_val] &lt;size&gt;

 &gt; +     Fftm 2D [Inv|Fwd] &lt;I&gt;-&lt;O&gt; [by_ref|by_val] &lt;row_size&gt;x&lt;col_size&gt;

All Fftm's are 2D.  However, the can either be row-wise or column-wise.
Perhaps this could be:

         Fftm [row|col] [Inv|Fwd] &lt;I&gt;-&lt;O&gt; [by_ref|by_val] 
&lt;row_size&gt;x&lt;col_size&gt;

 &gt; +     Fir &lt;T&gt; &lt;size&gt;
 &gt; +     Iir &lt;T&gt; &lt;size&gt;
 &gt; +
 &gt; +     --matvec--
 &gt; +     dot &lt;T&gt; &lt;size&gt;x1
 &gt; +     cvjdot &lt;T&gt; &lt;size&gt;x1
 &gt; +     trans &lt;T&gt; &lt;row_size&gt;x&lt;col_size&gt;
 &gt; +     herm &lt;T&gt; &lt;row_size&gt;x&lt;col_size&gt;
 &gt; +     kron &lt;T&gt; &lt;row_size_a&gt;x&lt;col_size_a&gt; &lt;row_size_b&gt;x&lt;col_size_b&gt;
 &gt; +     outer &lt;T&gt; &lt;size_a&gt;x1 &lt;size_b&gt;x1
 &gt; +     gemp &lt;T&gt; &lt;row_size_a&gt;x&lt;col_size_a&gt; &lt;row_size_b&gt;x&lt;col_size_b&gt;
 &gt; +     gems &lt;T&gt; &lt;row_size&gt;x&lt;col_size&gt;
 &gt; +     cumsum &lt;T&gt; &lt;row_size&gt;x&lt;col_size&gt;
 &gt; +     modulate &lt;T&gt; &lt;row_size&gt;x1
 &gt; +
 &gt; +     --fns--

&quot;--Element-wise expressions--&quot; would be more descriptive to the user.

Also (although some of this is redundant with above)

&quot;For element-wise expressions, event tags have the following format:

	EVALUATOR DIM EXPR SIZE

The EVALUATOR indicates which VSIPL++ evaluator was dispatched to
compute the expression.

DIM indicates the dimensionality of the expression.

EXPR is memonic of the expression.

SIZE is ...&quot;

Also, a brief description of the evaluators would be useful:

&quot;The following evaluators are provided (Dispath to vendor math
libraries, such as SAL and IPP, is implemented with multiple
evaluators that share the same prefix):

  - Expr_Loop      - generic loop-fusion evaluator.
  - Expr_SIMD_Loop - SIMD loop-fusion evaluator.
  - Expr_Copy      - optimized data-copy evaluator.
  - Expr_Trans     - optimized matrix transpose evaluator.
  - Expr_Dense     - evaluator for dense, multi-dimensional expressions.
                     Converts them into corresponding 1-dim expressions
                     that are re-dispatched.
  - Expr_SAL_*     - evaluators for dispatch to the SAL vendor math library.
  - Expr_IPP_*     - evaluators for dispatch to the SAL vendor math library.
  - Expr_SIMD_*    - evaluators for dispatch to the builtin SIMD routines
                     (with the exception of Expr_SIMD_Loop, see above).

A complete listing of the evaluators is useful, but I would be OK with
leaving it out in favor of a condense list (Expr_SAL_* instead of a
complete listing of the SAL evaluators).  The complete list is going
to fluctuate and its going to have extraneous detail that we won't
docuemnt here (for example, this isn't the place to describe the
difference between Expr_IPP_SV-&lt;func&gt; and Expr_IPP_SV_FO-&lt;func&gt; and
between Expr_SAL_VVV and Expr_SAL_fVVV).

The condensed list should be enough for the user to determine if their
functions was dispatched to a math library (i.e. Expr_IPP_*), handled
internally in an optimized fashioned, or just handled with loop
fusion.


 &gt; +     Expr_Loop [1D|2D|3D] &lt;expr&gt; &lt;size&gt;
 &gt; +     Expr_Copy      &quot;       &quot;              (all have dim/expr/size)
 &gt; +     Expr_Trans
 &gt; +     Expr_Dense
 &gt; +     Expr_SAL_COPY
 &gt; +     Expr_SAL_V
