<PRE>
This patch fixes some typos/grammar/etc. in the tutorial.  There's
clearly more we could do to improve the documentation, but this will
do for the upcoming release.

Jules, Don, I noticed that there's no performance graph for the
temporal-locality version of the parallel fast convolution.  Is that
graph available?

Thanks,
