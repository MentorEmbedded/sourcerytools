 &gt; sorry for having dropped the ball here. The patch looks good. I only
 &gt; have the usual nit-picks, but nothing blocking.
 &gt;
 &gt; A general question concerning the expected usage: By replacing the
 &gt; template parameter by a function parameter you make the choice of a pool
 &gt; a runtime-only thing. Who do you expect will use pools explicitly, and
 &gt; how ? Is this runtime-binding really going to be used by end-users, or
 &gt; is it merely a convenience for us during R&amp;D ?
 &gt; (I could think of ways to keep the allocator a compile-time parameter,
 &gt; but allow us to configure in a special allocator that calls into a
 &gt; runtime-polymorphic pool type such as the one you implement here...)

I don't think that an allocator choosen at compile time is the best
choice.  We've had it implemented that way for a long time, and it
didn't seem that useful.  In particular:

  - The main reason is that I don't think it is a good idea to increase
    the type diversity for something that doesn't bring a lot of
    optimization potential.

    Block allocation/deallocation is infrequent, done once per block,
    and usually done outside of the computation loop.  Each block's
    allocator will only perform one allocation.  Extra efficiency
    from a compile-time allocator doesn't buy as much.

    By comparison, stdlib containers use one allocator to allocate
    entries in the container (sharing a single allocator across
    multiple allocations).  The allocations/deallocations presumably
    occur with some frequency, during computations.

  - As implemented, the compile-time allocator was a template
    parameteter of the Dense_storage implementation, and not accessible
    from Dense or Dense_impl.  Extending Dense to allow different
    allocators to be choosen would require extending its type interface,
    either directly, or through another type (such as Local_map).


Allocation pools should be useful in general, beyond just making huge
page memory easier to allocate for benchmarks.  One &quot;in the wild&quot;
example would be to allocate memory in a pool that has some special
memory attribute (such as being part of shared region, or being part
of memory that can be accessed via DMA).  This type of thing comes up
often when dealing with I/O devices.

You can achieve a similar effect with admit/release, but some
kind of block factory with an attached pool would be much easier.

 &gt;
 &gt; Is this patch really this old ? :-)

It is old, eh?  It dates back to the VSIPL++ proof of concept we did
for IBM last year.  This, and the attributes on local maps to set the
number of SPUs never went into SVN, mostly because I was nervous about
the local map attributes.


 &gt;
 &gt;&gt; +    @brief   VSIPL++ Library: Memory allocation pool
 &gt;&gt; +*/
 &gt;
 &gt; I would prefer to name the pool actually Memory_pool, to make it clear
 &gt; that we are talking about memory management here, not threading (say).

Ah yes, good idea.

 &gt;
 &gt;&gt; +template &lt;typename T&gt;
 &gt;&gt; +inline T*
 &gt;&gt; +pool_alloc(
 &gt;&gt; +  Pool*       pool,
 &gt;&gt; +  length_type size)
 &gt;&gt; +{
 &gt;&gt; +  return (T*)(pool-&gt;allocate(size * sizeof(T)));
 &gt;&gt; +}
 &gt;
 &gt; I understand the need for 'pool_alloc' being a separate function from
 &gt; the virtual Pool::allocate, but I'd still prefer this to become a member
 &gt; function. What about
 &gt;
 &gt; class Memory_pool
 &gt; {
 &gt; public:
 &gt;   virtual void *allocate(length_type);
 &gt;   template &lt;typename T&gt;
 &gt;   T * allocate(length_type);
 &gt; };

Sounds good, I'll give that a try.
