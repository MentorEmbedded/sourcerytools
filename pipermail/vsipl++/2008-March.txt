Subject: Sourcery VSIPL++ 1.4 Available
Message-ID: <47CC0D7B.6020708@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery is pleased to announce the availability of Sourcery
VSIPL++ 1.4.  This is a new version of Sourcery VSIPL++, a toolkit for
developing high-performance signal- and image-processing applications,
has a number of improvements and new features.  Highlights include
numerous additional optimizations, extended dispatch to vendor
libraries, and example projects for using Intel's compilers from
within Microsoft Visual Studio for Windows.

This version of Sourcery VSIPL++ contains several previews of
technology that will be fully available in future Sourcery VSIPL++
releases.  In particular it includes support for accelerating a select
set of operations on the Cell/B.E. processor architecture, support for
stencil operations, and support for a select set of image processing
operations.

Sourcery VSIPL++ is a full implementation of the VSIPL++ API, an open
standard for platform-independent signal- and image-processing
developed by the DOD High Performance Embedded Computing Software
Initiative (HPEC-SI) and the VSIPL Forum. Sourcery VSIPL++ provides
many high-level routines used in SIP computing, such as FFTs, FIR
filters, SVD and QR decomposition, and linear algebra.

Subject: [patch] Fix SAL SVD buglet
Message-ID: <47ED45BD.9010501@codesourcery.com>

The SAL SVD backend defined 'scalar_type' twice.  GCC 4.1 complains, but 
GCC 3.4 and GHS don't.

This patch also includes an MCOE 1.4 fix already in the changelog but 
not committed.

Patch applied.
