Hi folks,

Just wondering why would vsipl++ report a different number of processors
than sysconf?

The Program: 

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   vsipl init(argc, argv);

   std::cout << "num_processors as reported by vsipl++: " <<
num_processors() << std::endl;

   std::cout << "num_processors as reported by sysconf(
_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF ): " 
             << sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) << std::endl;


   return(0);
}

The Result:
num_processors as reported by vsipl++: 1
num_processors as reported by sysconf( _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF ): 8


Do I need to necessarily run a vsipl++ program using mpirun, i.e:

"mpirun -np${num_processors} ./vsipl_tester" 

In order for vsipl++ to recognize that there are multiple processors
installed on the machine?

Thanks,
Bill

This is because they have different notions of what a "processor" is. 
One uses it for a piece of hardware, the other for an MPI-enabled 
process that participates in a parallel computation.

Yes. Or more specifically, Sourcery VSIPL++ still won't recognize the 
number of CPUs or cores. It will report the number of processes started 
via `mpirun`, which is the number of processes potentially participating 
in the computations of your program.

Thanks for the reply.  So, reading between the lines here...VSIP++, via
openMIP mechanisms, takes care of MPI intricacies.

Yes, that's right.
