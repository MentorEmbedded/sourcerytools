(The -f option shouldn't be necessary. The reason we use GNUmakefile
 instead of Makefile is to make clear (to 'make') that we really require
 GNU make -- which detects GNUmakefiles automatically. Other versions of
 make won't be able to handle our build system anyway.)

&gt;<i> and it succeeds. Then I change directories to tests/ref-impl and try
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;make -fMakefile check&quot;. For the tests, the Makefile and Makefile.inc

</I>
That may be the root of the problem. tests/ref-impl/ doesn't come with
a 'Makefile', only with a 'GNUmakefile'. That, however, is obsolete, and
not used by our testing harness.

(Our testing harness uses QMTest, and to invoke it you run 'make check'
 from the toplevel directory. We also support compiling individual tests
 in a way as not to require QMTest, though the ref-impl test suite doesn't
 seem to be supported that way. I would suggest to modify / add to the
 tests_cxx_sources variable in tests/GNUmakefile.inc to include tests/ref-impl/*.cpp.

 Once that is done, you can run 'make tests/ref-impl/math-matvec' from the toplevel
 directory.)

&gt;<i> I've played some with the flags used to compile the tests (removed -O2
</I>&gt;<i> and -pedantic), but nothing has changed the result. I hope your attempt

</I>
As I can't reproduce this with my (Linux-based) version of GCC 3.4.5, and
since this looks like a C++ frontend issue, rather than a platform-specific
problem, I'm tempted to believe that the cause is related to your writing
your own Makefile for tests/ref-impl/.

Regards,
