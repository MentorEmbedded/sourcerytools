Subject: [patch] New configure options for use w/eclipse, misc fixes
Message-ID: <46895E4A.9010207@codesourcery.com>

This patch ...

... adds a new configure option "--disable-shared-acconfig" that moves 
defines currently on the compiler the command line (to enable shared 
acconfig.hpp across multiple variants in a binary package) into 
acconfig.hpp.  This is useful when building a binary package to be used 
from eclipse, since there is less stuff to type into eclipse's phalanx 
of dialog boxes.

... adds a new configure option "--disable-fftw3-simd" that disables the 
builtin FFTW from using SIMD.  Useful when cross-building for a Power 
platform (such as powerpc-eabi) that doesn't have altivec.

... fixes recursive builtin lapack make's to use $(MAKE).  Fixes bug 
reported w/Solaris AMD64.

... removes missing define from expr/generator_block.hpp.  Fixes vramp, 
I think.

Patch applied.

Subject: [patch] External data access example
Message-ID: <46A4FE66.8040100@codesourcery.com>

This patch adds an example where the values of a VSIPL++ Matrix are 
altered using a direct pointer to the underlying data.  This is useful 
for performing operations on data outside the VSIPL++ library.

Regards,

Subject: Configuration and compile problems with ICL
Message-ID: <5CD1C9B961A59D4592F02D12CD93238B0813B1F9@STITCH.essexcorp.com>

Hi,

 

I am trying to build VSIPL++ with the Intel compiler and Cygwin on an
Intel EMT64 System and running into a few problems. 

I have installed trial versions of the Intel Compiler (10.0.026), IPP
library (5.2.057) and MKL library (9.1.025). We are using Visual C++
2005 Express edition with the Platform SDK (Server 2003 R2) installed.
I tried to run the configure script using the Cygwin shell.

 

I started with the following configuration line from the quickstart
guide:

 

./configure CXX=icl CC=icl CXXFLAGS="/Qcxx-features /Qvc8"
--build=i686-cygwin --host=i686-mingw32 --enable-ipp=win
--enable-fft=ipp --with-lapack=mkl_win --disable-mpi

 

This initially failed when checking the compiler. I made sure the
include library paths were available to the Cygwin shell and then the
compiler check completed but configure failed on the IPP step as
follows.

 

...

Using IPP for Windows.

checking for ipps.h... yes

checking for ippsMul_32f... configure: error: not found.

 

 

 

Trying without IPP, 

 

./configure CXX=icl CC=icl CXXFLAGS="/Qcxx-features /Qvc8"
--build=i686-cygwin --host=i686-mingw32 --with-lapack=mkl_win
--disable-mpi

 

then failed on the MKL step as follows: 

...

with_lapack: mkl_win

Searching for LAPACK packages: mkl_win

checking for LAPACK/MKL 8.x library for windown... not found

configure: error: LAPACK enabled but no library found

 

This looks like a version issue is there a workaround?

 

 

 

Finally with both IPP and MKL removed,

 

./configure CXX=icl CC=icl CXXFLAGS="/Qcxx-features /Qvc8"
--build=i686-cygwin --host=i686-mingw32 --disable-mpi

 

I get this failure:

 

...

checking for asm style... configure: error: cannot determine asm type.

=============================================================

configure: error: built-in ATLAS configure FAILED.

 

This seems to be addressed in a prior post so I'm not to concerned about
it if it has been patched.

 

 

Please let me know if you have any insights on these problems. I suspect
it is a preferred installation configuration or a tool version issue but
I can't find indications that the tools I am using are incorrect or
detailed guidance on preferred tool configuration and setup in the
documentation. Thanks.

Subject: [patch] Fix distributed maxval bug, split large tests
Message-ID: <46A9DFE6.40203@codesourcery.com>

This patch fixes a bug causing distributed maxval not to work with 
matrices and tensors.

It also splits apart several large tests (coverage_unary and fft) into 
smaller tests.

Patch applied.

Subject: [patch] FFTW split complex fixes; SIMD unaligned fixes
Message-ID: <46ADDF95.2080602@codesourcery.com>

This patch fixes and works around several bugs in split-complex FFT and 
unaligned SIMD expressions.

Split-complex FFT support using FFTW was failing numerous tests.  This 
was a combination of bugs and unimplemented functionality in VSIPL++, 
and bugs in FFTW.

* The VSIPL++ split complex to complex transforms (both FFT and FFTM) 
did not handle inverse transforms at all.

* Split real-to-complex and complex-to-real transforms for FFTM were 
unimplemented.

* FFTW (3.1.2 at least) plans capture the gap between real and imaginary 
components for in-place complex FFTs, and for real-complex and 
complex-real FFTs.  If the plan is executed with data with a different 
gap, all heck breaks loose.  Work around is to copy data into buffers 
with same alignment as during planning.


Unaligned SIMD (handling multiple unaligned vectors with the same 
alignment) was broken.  Instead of incrementing past the unaligned 
section, it would decrement before.  This caused it to skip the last 
aligned word of the expressions.  Fix is to make increment_by_element 
explicit.


Patch to be applied, pending test results.
