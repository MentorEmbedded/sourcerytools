I think we want versioned .so files if we ever include shared libraries 
in our binary packages.

I'm going to punt for now to get this to our customer more quickly.

Stefan,

Thanks for the feedback!  I've incorporated your suggestions.

Users of the rule include $(libs) in the dependencies, so it gets picked 
up in $^.

Oops, this removal wasn't intentional.  Let me double-check how that 
happened.

Right, we definitely want to avoid more variants!

This change still builds (and installs) both libsvpp.so and .a. 
However, it uses -fPIC code for both (arguably lowering performance). 
However, a quick & dirty BM of SSAR didn't show a noticable difference.

Like version numbers, if we package this, let's revisit building both 
fPIC and non-fPIC code.

Brooks,

Thanks for the feedback!  I've incorporated your suggestions (sans 
version numbers, which I think is a good idea too).

Sorry it wasn't clear, but this is a bug fix.  CFLAGS was defined twice.
