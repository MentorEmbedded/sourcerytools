Precisely. It allows an installation into a fake (virtual) root that
then only contains the newly installed bits, so tar will not pick up
any undesired pieces.

&gt;<i> However, there might be a problem when trying to build one copy of the 
</I>&gt;<i> ATLAS/FFTW libraries to be used by all variants.  Consider:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # first, build optimized version of VSIPL++, ATLAS, and FFTW

</I>&gt;<i> --prefix=$prefix
</I>&gt;<i> make
</I>&gt;<i> make doc maintainer_mode=1
</I>&gt;<i> make install DESTDIR=tmp suffix=-opt
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # second, build debug version of VSIPL++,
</I>&gt;<i> # Don't build ATLAS and FFTW again, instead use the versions already in 
</I>&gt;<i> /opt/vsipl++
</I>&gt;<i> LDFLAGS=&quot;-L$prefix/lib&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> CPPFLAGS=&quot;-L$prefix/include&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> configure &quot;debug-flags&quot; --with-fft=fftw3 -with-lapack=atlas
</I>&gt;<i> make
</I>&gt;<i> make install DESTDIR=tmp suffix=-debug
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... make other variants ...
</I>&gt;<i> ... create alias (vsipl++.pc -&gt; vsipl++-opt.pc)
</I>&gt;<i> ... make binary package ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When configuring for the debug build, the libraries for ATLAS and FFTW 
</I>&gt;<i> will not be found, since they are in /tmp/opt/vsipl++, not 
</I>&gt;<i> /opt/vsipl++.  Also, when making the debug library, the headers will not 
</I>&gt;<i> be in the right spot either.
</I>
That's right. In fact, we touched that subject when discussing the suffix
option previously. Being able to package all variants into a single prefix,
and sharing the same set of headers, imposes some constraints on how much
the different configurations can actually differ.
I think we were discussing the suffix flag in the context of differing
compilation flags (e.g. -g vs. -O3), but not e.g. using IPP vs. ATLAS.

Such differences will probably have to be installed in distinct prefixes
for a number of reasons, for example because the generated config header
isn't the same.

&gt;<i> A work around is to build the ATLAS and FFTW libraries for each variant 
</I>&gt;<i> (optimized, debug, etc), rely on them to be overwritten so that only one 
</I>&gt;<i> copy of those libraries are in the final package,  and make sure to 
</I>&gt;<i> build the version of the external libraries that we want to keep last.  
</I>&gt;<i> However, if we have many variants, this will result in a lot of time 
</I>&gt;<i> spent building ATLAS.
</I>
I haven't looked into the vendor package compilation, but my impression
was that we now have no way to distinguish different configurations
at link time. Am I wrong ? The only configurations that can coexist
are one configuration without and one with ATLAS (say). However, there
is still the acconfig.hpp issue I mentioned above...

&gt;<i> Another idea is to have ATLAS and FFTW installed on our build system so 
</I>&gt;<i> that the bogus paths are not noticed by configure/make.  However this 
</I>&gt;<i> makes the build process a little less robust.
</I>
Indeed. I think we should make sure the compilation is as isolated as
possible, and thus can be reproduced anywhere without reliance on external
resources that aren't explicitely described in the documentation.

&gt;<i> A final idea is to tell configure to trust that fftw3 and atlas are 
</I>&gt;<i> present and not test for them.  (&quot;--with-fft=trust-fftw3&quot; ?).  We would 
</I>&gt;<i> also need to handle the include paths during the make (via INT_CPPFLAGS?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts on how to handle this?
</I>
I really doubt the suffix-only approach is able to deal with multiple
vendor library versions. We really need different prefixes for that.

&gt;&gt;<i> Mark, doc/csl-docbook/GNUmakefile.inc contains two changes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * I prefixed all installation paths with $(DESTDIR) to make the above
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   work for documentation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * I fixed the %.html target for the case where $(docbook_html) is not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   as that case seems to have slipped through in Carlos' latest 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adjustments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there an email list that we should send csl-docbook CVS changes to?
</I>
I had planned to send the changelog to gnu-internal.

Regards,
		Stefan
