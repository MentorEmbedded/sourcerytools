</I>
Yes, it does affect GD.  This instruction:

    0x08 addiu $4, $28, %tlsgd(x)               R_MIPS_TLS_GD   x  

assumes that the GD entry in the GOT is within 64k of $28; this
assumption prohibits the use of xgot.  However, like the rest of xgot,
this can wait a little longer.

&gt;<i> 3. Should we use Model I or Model II from Drepper's paper?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This issue does not arise for Global/Local Dynamic.
</I>
Well, not for the binutils and GCC portions of the implementation,
anyway.

&gt;<i> 4. Does __tls_get_addr need a special calling convention?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This issue does not matter until we start doing linker optimizations.  
</I>&gt;<i> Until that time, the compiler can be conservative, and assume this is an 
</I>&gt;<i> ordinary call.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The following issue does need resolution:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Should we extend the 32K Local Dynamic Model to 64K by using a biased 
</I>&gt;<i> offset?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel and I thought this would be more trouble than it's worth; Thiemo 
</I>&gt;<i> thinks otherwise.  Are there any other opinions?
</I>
I have since learned that PowerPC already does this:

|<i> The PowerPC32 TLS ABI is similar to the PowerPC64 model.  The
</I>|<i> thread-local storage data structures follow variant I.  The TCB is 8
</I>|<i> bytes, with the first 4 bytes containing the pointer to the dynamic
</I>|<i> thread vector. tlsoffset calculations and definition of __tls_get_addr
</I>|<i> are identical to PowerPC64.  r2 is the thread pointer, and points
</I>|<i> 0x7000 past the end of the thread control block.  Dynamic thread vector
</I>|<i> pointers point 0x8000 past the start of each TLS block.  (*) This
</I>|<i> allows the first 64K of each block to be addressed from a dtv pointer
</I>|<i> using fewer machine instructions.  The tp offset allows for efficient
</I>|<i> addressing of the TCB and up to 4K-8 of other thread library
</I>|<i> information.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> (*) For implementation reasons the actual value stored in dtv may point
</I>|<i> to the start of a block, however values returned by accessor functions
</I>|<i> will be offset by 0x8000.
</I>
So for local dynamic, offsets would be biased by 0x8000 instead of 0;
for initial exec, offsets would be biased by -0x7000 instead of +8. 
This leaves room for the pthread descriptor to be accessed in a single
instruction as long as it is no more than 4k-8 bytes.

Shall we use this model?
