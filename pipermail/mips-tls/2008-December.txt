Subject: Question about MIPS-TLS DTP relocations
Message-ID: <7c3ac71c0812290326r4dc7e080ma251b21fb5023222@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

With reference to the TLS Support in MIPS, I have one question regarding
MIPS relocations in dynamic linker for static tls objects.

I have my own system libraries, which contains static __thread tls data
types in it.

The readelf of my library shows the following:

readelf -a ./lib/libX.so | grep TLS
  TLS            0x0987a8 0x000a87a8 0x000a87a8 0x00000 0x0000c R   0x4
000adb30  00000026 R_MIPS_TLS_DTPMOD

When I prepare my executable and run it, dynamic linker fails to relocate
the symbols and aborts.

My question is we do not have a relocation type of R_MIPS_TLS_DTPMOD,
instead we have R_MIPS_TLS_DTPMOD32 and R_MIPS_TLS_DTPMOD64.
So my dynamic linker is correct?? Do i need to use -fPIE, instead of -fPIC.

Is my understanding correct. Where could be the problem.

Thanks in advance,

Sounds like your dynamic linker does not support TLS.

Try readelf -W (--wide).  It's just cutting off the last few
characters.
