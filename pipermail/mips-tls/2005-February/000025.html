I think it's the mechanism, but Daniel could answer more definitively. 
I know that there's a kernel patch out there to interpret the rdhwr 
instruction -- but from the toolchain point of view I can't see any 
reason to think that any single instruction couldn't be used just as well.

&gt;<i> The alternatives seem to be to use a GPR (but this requires an ABI change)

</I>
I don't remember quite what happenned to the idea of putting the value 
at some known location in memory.  I think that Dan shot this down 
relatively effectively, but I can't remember on quite what basis.  One 
downside is that it means that all implementations will always be 
somewhat inefficient; you're going to take a memory access hit, no 
matter what improvements are made to the architecture.

&gt;<i> So my feedback on the use of rdhwr (or any other instruction that traps) is
</I>&gt;<i> that as long as this is a short-term solution and/or we understand the
</I>&gt;<i> performance implications of how often that trap happens, it's OK.  Depending
</I>&gt;<i> on rdhwr to appear in a real implementation any time in the next 2-3 years
</I>&gt;<i> simply isn't going to happen.
</I>
I think that matches our expectations.  My understanding is that we'll 
have a new MIPS ABI, probably with a GPR for the thread pointer, by
then.  So, I think we should view this as short-term hack to o32.
