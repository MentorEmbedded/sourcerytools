That's why I suggested, as a possible compromise, that we require that 
compilers/linkers mark the rdhwr instruction with a relocation.  That 
would allow dynamic linkers to make appropriate changes to the code, if 
appropriate.

To me, this seems like a very practical way of moving forward with our 
current implementation, while hedging our bets; what do you and others 
think?

&gt;<i> If we're not prepared to change things if we find a performance problem, I

</I>
I desparately want to avoid getting into an ARM/MIPS controversy.

(CodeSourcery is not an advocate for one architecture over the other; we 
are pleased to work with many major semiconductor vendors, and while 
loyal to each of our customers, neutral overall.)

However, I will say that the ARM GNU/Linux community and ARM, Ltd., are 
not necessarily of one mind on this topic.  I believe (thought I 
certainly cannot speak for them) that ARM, Ltd., is OK with the 
requirement that, to get maximum NPTL/TLS performance, you use an ARM V6 
chip and the new ARM ABI, including a coprocessor-read instruction to 
access the thread pointer.  The ARM GNU/Linux commmunity seems to have a 
greater attachment to the old ABI and a greater desire to hardware 
without the appropriate coprocessors.
