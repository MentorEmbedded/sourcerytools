My point is for NPTL to work.  Specifically:

  - Tying it to a new ABI is unacceptable in the short term, and
    possibly in the longer term, because of community pushback against
    additional ABIs.

  - Using a wired TLB entry gives kernel developers the shakes, because
    it restricts the available TLB slots, which can have complex
    effects on the performance of existing applications.

That only leaves methods which enter the kernel.  Our choices are via a
load from an unmapped page, via a syscall, or via an RI exception. 
Only one of those models is compatible with acceleration via future
hardware.

Using rdhwr does not provide cripplingly slow - or even perceptibly
slow - performance, and I'm using a much more expensive emulation layer
than Maciej's.  If the MIPS folks can clearly justify their concerns
about this solution, and some relevant ideas to benchmark the problem,
then maybe we can make forward progress.

As was just pointed out to me, Maciej's numbers are on the same order
of magnitude as a load miss.  Note that the rdhwr is never needed more
than once per function with an optimizing compiler.  I think that at
the cost of a load miss, you're getting a bargain.
