I'm not too concerned here because currently there seems to be very little
code available that exploits TLS.  As time progresses more such code
will be written and that I hope would be sufficient time for the hardware
folks, if we deciede to take that route.

&gt;<i> But I don't yet understand how important the thread pointer access
</I>&gt;<i> time is for a typical threaded program. Can we get a better idea of
</I>&gt;<i> the dynamic frequency of thread register loads? Does anyone know some

</I>
That's a not very quantitative statement but the Alpha people are
apparently very satisfied with their PAL code exception based solution.
At least so said rth when I last spoke to him.

&gt;<i> To maintain single-threaded performance we'd perhaps want to increment
</I>&gt;<i> the Wired count only when running real TLS code, so as not to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> the number of TLB entries available for random replacement for the
</I>&gt;<i> majority single-threaded applications.

My general feeling it's the kind of tradeoff that are sort of the
equivalent to juggling with razor blades with closed eyes ;-)  Or
translated into plain English, it's one of those optimizations which I
think have a strong potencial to fire back and actually result in a loss.
It's hard to say without actual application and without knowing the
size of the workload in advance.

&gt;<i> For multi-threaded CPUs the ultimate solution is the new ABI which
</I>&gt;<i> reserves a GPR for the thread register. But in the short-term, before
</I>&gt;<i> that new ABI is fully supported, a rdhwr-based implementation could be

</I>
A new ABI is alot of work, will take time and not last convincing.  We
want something sooner than that could happen.

&gt;<i> How do people feel about supporting two different TLS implementations
</I>&gt;<i> on top of the existing MIPS ABIs - one optimised for legacy MIPS CPUs,
</I>&gt;<i> and another for multi-threaded CPUs - similar to what ARM Linux seems
</I>&gt;<i> to be considering for SMP?
</I>
It's a bit like hardware and software floating point, ll/sc and non-ll/sc
binaries which are flavours which we already have.  Once can only hope
that the number of binary variants won't reach the actual worst case
number.
