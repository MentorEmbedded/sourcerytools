<PRE>
Daniel,

&gt;<i> We have the 32-bit port of NPTL basically working now, and I have been
</I>&gt;<i> preparing the first patches for submission - which means binutils.  So
</I>&gt;<i> I have been going over the ABI in some detail looking for things that
</I>&gt;<i> we want to finalize before the patches are integrated.  I found three
</I>&gt;<i> points...
</I>
Thanks, ace work.  I hope we'll be in a position to pick this stuff up
fairly soon and beat on it.

&gt;<i> Second, the %tpoff operator is currently ambiguous.  When we say
</I>&gt;<i> %dtpoff, we are always talking about the offset from the base of this
</I>&gt;<i> module's DTV entry to the location of the variable; currently this is
</I>&gt;<i> always used with %hi and %lo.  However, %tpoff can be used with %hi and
</I>&gt;<i> %lo (Local Exec model, refers to variable offset from thread pointer)
</I>&gt;<i> %or without (Initial Exec model, refers to GOT slot holding the
</I>&gt;<i> variable offset).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How about this instead?
</I>&gt;<i>   R_MIPS_TLS_TPOFF -&gt; R_MIPS_TLS_GOTTPOFF
</I>&gt;<i>   %tpoff(x)($28) -&gt; %gottpoff(x)($28)
</I>
Sounds better.

&gt;<i> Third, the Design Choices section of the specification has this to say:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      *  The compiler is not allowed to schedule the sequences below. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   The sequences below must appear exactly as written in the code
</I>&gt;<i>   generated by the compiler. This restriction is present because we have
</I>&gt;<i>   not yet determined what linker optimizations may be possible. In order
</I>&gt;<i>   to facilitate adding linker optimizations in the future, without
</I>&gt;<i>   recompiling current code, the compiler is restricted from scheduling
</I>&gt;<i>   these sequences. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to settle this one way or the other before finalizing the
</I>&gt;<i> spec.
</I>
Why not sit on the fence?  See below.

&gt;<i> The major advantage here is replacing a call to __tls_get_addr with a
</I>&gt;<i> rdhwr instruction.  These are, in theory, doable for MIPS.
</I>
Mike Uhler responded separately about MIPS Technologies' position on
using rdhwr for this purpose.

For NUBI we plan to reserve a general purpose register for a thread
pointer, making the optimization a bigger win.

&gt;<i> There are a couple of other quirks for this; the only one I can think
</I>&gt;<i> of offhand is MIPS-I load delay slots, which would mean neither
</I>&gt;<i> sequence could be used as-is.
</I>
There are relatively few MIPS-I machines out there.  Would it be
unacceptable if the standard NPTL system failed to work on them?

&gt;<i> The immediate disadvantage is that the compiler can not schedule the
</I>&gt;<i> sequences.  I don't know what all the tradeoffs are here, I just
</I>&gt;<i> know that the compiler implementation would be simpler if we did not
</I>&gt;<i> make the sequences fixed and unschedulable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I'd like to ditch that unless folks think that
</I>&gt;<i>   (A) the linker optimizations are useful
</I>&gt;<i>   (B) the linker optimizations are feasible
</I>&gt;<i>   (C) someone is likely to implement the linker optimizations
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any opinions?  I see that Alpha does implement the TLS linker
</I>&gt;<i> relaxations; on the other hand, Alpha already had a linker relaxation
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism in place, and the GNU tools for MIPS don't.
</I>
Why not re-write the spec to say &quot;unless you generate this sequence
exactly like this, you'll probably prevent any future linker
optimization from working&quot; - and then leave it to the compiler
toolchain. 

My opinion is that linker optimizations could be very valuable, given
a cheap way of accessing a thread pointer.  But MIPS Technologies are
very unlikely to do heroic work on the linker for the o32 ABI - but we
do intend to at least try that out for our NUBI ABI.
