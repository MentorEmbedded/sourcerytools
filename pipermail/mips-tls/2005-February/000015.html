<PRE>The one area that I'm concerned about is the use of rdhwr to return the
pointer.  There are several reasons why I'm not sure this is the right thing
to do:

- rdhwr is a MIPS32/64 Release 2 instruction.  No existing MIPS I-IV
implementation has this instruction and probably never will.  Even existing
MIPS3264 Release 2 implementations don't have the internal register to hold
the data.  This means that it will be years before any hardware will support
the feature, and that support depends on an architecture decision (see next
item)

- We have some concerns at the architecture level about using rdhwr for this
purpose rather than using a GPR under the umbrella of an ABI re-work that
some of you are involved in.

- Some preliminary work at MIPS suggests that a tuned handler for syscall is
faster than one for handling rdhwr at the reserved instruction handler.
This means that we're betting on having actual hardware implementations of
rdhwr out there in sufficient volume to make up for the fact that we're
penalizing everybody else by using an RI trap hander vs. a syscall trap
handler.

To me, all of these suggest that we may want to use syscall rather than
rdhwr to get the pointer, at least until we can decide whether to dedicate a
GPR for this purpose.

By the way, sorry for the late response to the original posting.  There was
some confusion within MIPS as to who was going to respond.  I've asked our
UK team to run point on the interaction on TLS from now on, so we'll be more
responsive.

Subject: [mips-tls] A couple of potential changes to the MIPS TLS ABI


Hi folks,

We have the 32-bit port of NPTL basically working now, and I have been
preparing the first patches for submission - which means binutils.  So I
have been going over the ABI in some detail looking for things that we want
to finalize before the patches are integrated.  I found three points...


First, a minor correction: LE was using &quot;ori&quot; where the equivalent LD
sequence used &quot;addiu&quot;.  I've updated this on the Wiki.  It was a leftover
from an earlier draft.



Second, the %tpoff operator is currently ambiguous.  When we say %dtpoff, we
are always talking about the offset from the base of this module's DTV entry
to the location of the variable; currently this is always used with %hi and
%lo.  However, %tpoff can be used with %hi and %lo (Local Exec model, refers
to variable offset from thread pointer) %or without (Initial Exec model,
refers to GOT slot holding the variable offset).

How about this instead?
  R_MIPS_TLS_TPOFF -&gt; R_MIPS_TLS_GOTTPOFF
  %tpoff(x)($28) -&gt; %gottpoff(x)($28)

This also frees up %tpoff in case we want to use that the way PowerPC uses
@tprel.  <A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mips-tls">foo at tprel</A>@l is the low 16 bits of the offset; <A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mips-tls">foo at tprel</A> s the low
16 bits also, but signals an error if the ofset does not fit entirely in 16
bits.  The alternate sequence III of Local Exec could take advantage of
this.



Third, the Design Choices section of the specification has this to say:

     *  The compiler is not allowed to schedule the sequences below. 

  The sequences below must appear exactly as written in the code
  generated by the compiler. This restriction is present because we have
  not yet determined what linker optimizations may be possible. In order
  to facilitate adding linker optimizations in the future, without
  recompiling current code, the compiler is restricted from scheduling
  these sequences. 

I'd like to settle this one way or the other before finalizing the spec.

For reference, the possible linker optimizations are:
 General Dynamic -&gt; Initial Exec (whenever linking an exec)  Local Dynamic
-&gt; Local Exec (ditto)  Initial Exec -&gt; Local Exec (when the symbol is known
to live in the
			     executable; can be applied starting at GD too)

The major advantage here is replacing a call to __tls_get_addr with a rdhwr
instruction.  These are, in theory, doable for MIPS.  Here's an example o32
GD -&gt; IE, probably the most important one:

   0x00 lw $25, %call16(__tls_get_addr)($28)   R_MIPS_CALL16   g
   0x04 jalr $25
   0x08 addiu $4, $28, %tlsgd(x)               R_MIPS_TLS_GD   x
   0x12 $gp restore (not mentioned in the TLS ABI)

   0x00 rdhwr $4, $5
   0x04 lw $5, %tpoff(x1)($28)         R_MIPS_TLS_TPOFF        x1
   0x08 addu $4, $4, $5
   0x12 the $gp restore can be nop'd out

There are a couple of other quirks for this; the only one I can think of
offhand is MIPS-I load delay slots, which would mean neither sequence could
be used as-is.  The immediate disadvantage is that the compiler can not
schedule the sequences.  I don't know what all the tradeoffs are here, I
just know that the compiler implementation would be simpler if we did not
make the sequences fixed and unschedulable. So I'd like to ditch that unless
folks think that
  (A) the linker optimizations are useful
  (B) the linker optimizations are feasible
  (C) someone is likely to implement the linker optimizations

Any opinions?  I see that Alpha does implement the TLS linker relaxations;
on the other hand, Alpha already had a linker relaxation mechanism in place,
and the GNU tools for MIPS don't.
