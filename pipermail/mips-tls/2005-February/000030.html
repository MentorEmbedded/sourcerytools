Can you compare this to the normal cost of an emulated instruction? 
I'm not sure if I've posted the rdhwr emulation patch anywhere; I know
Ralf has a copy.  I'm not thrilled about hardcoding the target
register but if that's what ya gotta do...

&gt;<i> But I don't yet understand how important the thread pointer access

</I>
TLS is a user level feature, so it's very difficult to predict access
patterns.  Glibc uses it for:
  - errno
  - locale data
  - pthread_self
There are, roughly, twentyish TLS traps in the startup of a typical
single-threaded application.  I do not know anything about thread
benchmarking so I can't give you much there.

&gt;<i> With regard to TLS on other architectures, people might like to read

</I>&gt;<i> Ah, I see that since I last looked, you've been contributing to that
</I>&gt;<i> discussion already Daniel.
</I>
I wrote most of that except for Nico's reimplementation.

&gt;<i> &gt; Want to talk to me more about using a parked TLB entry?  I spoke with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone (Ralf or Jun, probably) about the idea originally; I was told
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it wasn't possible on MIPS SMP implementations to make this work, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that there was some other reason why it was undesirable.  If that's not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accurate then we could use a reserved memory location.  However, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes the TLS model dependent on details of Linux's memory mapping -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not good for a hopefully generally useful ABI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While it's true that all threads within the same address space must
</I>&gt;<i> share a single page table, which would prevent such a trick being
</I>&gt;<i> implemented using the normal TLB refill mechanism, I think that it
</I>&gt;<i> might indeed be possible to implement this by using a per-thread wired
</I>&gt;<i> (parked) TLB entry, updated on a context switch. This would map a
</I>&gt;<i> magic page containing a copy of the thread pointer to a fixed virtual
</I>&gt;<i> address: if in the bottom 32K then it would need just one instruction
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. lw $v0,0x1000($0)).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A wired TLB entry like this should be fairly straightforward to
</I>&gt;<i> implement on even a simple RTOS, since it doesn't require a full-blown
</I>&gt;<i> VM system.  I don't see why it wouldn't work on an SMP system too,
</I>&gt;<i> since each CPU has its own TLB, and therefore a unique wired TLB
</I>&gt;<i> entry per active thread. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To maintain single-threaded performance we'd perhaps want to increment
</I>&gt;<i> the Wired count only when running real TLS code, so as not to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> the number of TLB entries available for random replacement for the
</I>&gt;<i> majority single-threaded applications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've spoken to Ralf about this idea, and though he's not thrilled by
</I>&gt;<i> it, he hasn't (yet) said that it couldn't work.
</I>
You can't do this for &quot;only single-threaded code&quot; - see above about
errno and locales.  TLS is either used by glibc or not.  When built for
NPTL, it's used.

I'm pretty dubious about the tradeoff of wiring a TLB entry for this.
Benchmarks will not accurately show the cost of having fewer available.

&gt;<i> But a notable downside of this technique is that it won't work on the
</I>&gt;<i> new generation of explicitly multi-threaded CPUs, which could be
</I>&gt;<i> executing instructions from many threads within the same address space
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;simultaneously&quot;, using a single, shared TLB.  On such CPUs the
</I>&gt;<i> memory-mapped thread pointer would require that the kernel not map the
</I>&gt;<i> wired page, and then emulate a faulting thread pointer load in the
</I>&gt;<i> page fault handler - rather defeating the point of having a CPU
</I>&gt;<i> designed to accelerate multi-threading.
</I>
Well, that's a bit of a full stop!  Now we've got _three_ TLS
mechanisms to contend with.  That's too many.

&gt;<i> How do people feel about supporting two different TLS implementations
</I>&gt;<i> on top of the existing MIPS ABIs - one optimised for legacy MIPS CPUs,
</I>&gt;<i> and another for multi-threaded CPUs - similar to what ARM Linux seems
</I>&gt;<i> to be considering for SMP?
</I>
I think it's a horrible, horrible idea.  Complexity has a cost too.

&gt;<i> &gt; Your point about the performance overhead of reading and decoding an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instruction is worth keeping in mind, but hasn't been a big
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; slowdown.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Measured how?
</I>
As I said, only casually.

&gt;<i>From this discussion I am still inclined to stay with rdhwr.  30-60
</I>cycles is not very long.
