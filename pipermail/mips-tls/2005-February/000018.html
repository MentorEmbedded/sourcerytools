I'm getting a lot of conflicting feedback about this.

Compare this to a syscall.  There is no existing implementation which
will implement the syscall efficiently, and _never_ will be.

&gt;<i> - We have some concerns at the architecture level about using rdhwr for this

</I>&gt;<i> some of you are involved in.
</I>
This objection is way too vague for me to respond to.  Also, using
rdhwr does not prevent future use of a GPR, in an ABI that doesn't
exist yet.  Nice thing about read-only state; you can keep it in
multiple places easily.

&gt;<i> - Some preliminary work at MIPS suggests that a tuned handler for syscall is
</I>&gt;<i> faster than one for handling rdhwr at the reserved instruction handler.
</I>&gt;<i> This means that we're betting on having actual hardware implementations of
</I>&gt;<i> rdhwr out there in sufficient volume to make up for the fact that we're
</I>&gt;<i> penalizing everybody else by using an RI trap hander vs. a syscall trap
</I>&gt;<i> handler.
</I>
So is this one.  Can you be more specific?  The only substantial
difference in overhead that I am familiar with is the additional
register save/restores; note that this is a substantial _advantage_ for
userland which would otherwise have to save and restore additional
registers.  Keeping the save/restores in the kernel is a win for code
size and complexity.

&gt;<i> To me, all of these suggest that we may want to use syscall rather than
</I>&gt;<i> rdhwr to get the pointer, at least until we can decide whether to dedicate a
</I>&gt;<i> GPR for this purpose.
</I>
In any case, I am putting Ralf on the hot seat here.  I'm going to do
whatever he likes, anyway, since it's no good to me if the kernel
doesn't support it :-)
