&gt;<i>From a technical POV it's not that hard to change the method. But

&gt;<i> So if we are proposing something that uses trap-and-emulate of rdhwr (whose

</I>&gt;<i> an initial proposal, and we're prepared to change it to address any
</I>&gt;<i> performance problem that we find, I'm OK with that.
</I>
The current state is already well beyond the proposal phase. A potential
change of the current implementation would need to happen soon, and
would also need a sound reasoning. (Mark's idea of attaching a marker
relocation to the instruction is probably the best to keep an emergency
exit open. It would trade startup time for a TLS access change.)

&gt;<i> If we're not prepared to change things if we find a performance problem, I
</I>&gt;<i> wonder why the burden of proof is on us to prove that we're not at a
</I>&gt;<i> competitive disadvantage (something the ARM folks are obviously concerned
</I>&gt;<i> about also) vs. the burden of proof being on having sufficient performance
</I>&gt;<i> analysis to know that it will be fine.
</I>
The burden of proof is always on the side who wants to change a
working solution. :-)
