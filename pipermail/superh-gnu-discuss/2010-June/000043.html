Hmm, that doesn't show an -rpath option, but then &quot;-v&quot; only reveals the 
collect2 command, which is usually much the same as ld. Just to be sure, 
try &quot;-Wl,-v&quot; which should reveal the ld command.

I'm not totally sure, but I think the &quot;rpath&quot; error message could be 
referring to the --sysroot option (which implies -rpath-link, at least). 
Does that path look ok to you?

If you remove the -m2a option, and --isa=sh2a perhaps also (both are 
redundant - SH-2A is the default), does that fix anything? What about if 
you delete your new &quot;specs&quot; file?
