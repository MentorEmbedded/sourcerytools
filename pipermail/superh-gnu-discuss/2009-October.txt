Subject: SH interrupt_handler function attribute register saving
Message-ID: <e462783bc19f676eb8acd6975bdf190e.squirrel@unimail.uni-dortmund.de>

Hi all,
I am currently implementing some interrupt routines for a SH2A device.

The interrupt function is defined like this:
void __attribute__ ((interrupt_handler)) INT_CMT1_CMI1(void)
{
    //do something
}

Unfortunately the programm crashes after the first interrupt. When looking
into the generated function entry/exit code by gcc, I noticed a mismatch
between the saved and rescued registers from stack:

00002180 2F06              MOV.L     R0, at -R15
00002182 2F16              MOV.L     R1, at -R15
00002184 2F26              MOV.L     R2, at -R15
00002186 2F36              MOV.L     R3, at -R15
....
000021A4 67F6              MOV.L     @R15+,R7
000021A6 66F6              MOV.L     @R15+,R6
000021A8 65F6              MOV.L     @R15+,R5
000021AA 64F6              MOV.L     @R15+,R4
000021AC 002B              RTE
000021AE 0009              NOP


Now, several questions arise:
Is this a bug? Did I do something wrong? Is there any way around (except
writing the routine in assembler by hand...)?

Hi Benjamin,

I am a little confused about the origin of your toolchain. Please could 
I ask you to post the output from gcc's --version option.

Thanks

Andrew

Hi Andrew,
sorry for that. It's the current SH-Lite toolchain:

Sorry Benjamin,

The current Lite release is purely for SH-4A targets. It has not been 
configured or tested for other SH targets.

If you require support for other SH targets please contact 
sales at codecourcery.com.

In the meantime, I suggest you write an assembler insert that saves the 
caller save registers, and then have that call a regular C function, 
without any attributes. Refer to the compiler's assembler output for how 
to define a function in assembler.

E.g.

asm ("
myinterruptentrypoint:
.....<save>
.....<call myinterrupthandler>
.....<load>");

void myinterrupthandler () {
   ....
}

There are probably other solutions also.

Andrew

Hi Fabio,

The complete set of commands used to build the binary toolchain are 
included in the source package. Naturally you will need to adjust these 
for your purposes.

However, I think your problems may be bigger than you think. :(

Building a toolchain for SH2A Linux is not going to be easy: the 
toolchain sources to not contain any support for the FDPIC memory model. 
I have heard of a FLT memory model port, but I'm not sure if that is 
included in these sources, or not. I've certainly never tried to build it.

The good news is that you should find that toolchain as supplied is 
sufficient to build an SH2A Linux kernel (provided that it is new enough 
not to depend on libgcc).

Sorry I could not be of more help

I'm not sure I understand the question.

The CodeSourcery Lite toolchain is based on the FSF tools with some 
custom patches for new features, bug fixes and such.

It is configured and tested for SH-4A, as you know, but should work for 
SH-2A provided that no libgcc is required (or other libraries). That 
said, it has not been tested for SH-2A so the may be bugs.

Hope that helps

Andrew

Thanks in advance and sorry.

Not at present, no. :(

CodeSourcery have one in development, but that won't be ready for 
release for some time.
