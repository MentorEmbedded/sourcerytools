Subject: SH2A toolchain Busybox issues
Message-ID: <201108231146.56508.andrea.baldini@spesonline.com>

Hi,

I'm using a RSK+7203 board and i've built 2.6.3x kernels and some different 
versions of busybox. (1.13.x, 1.17.x, 1.18.x) with the sh-uclinux toolchain 
for SH2A but i always get some bad behaviours when using some busybox applets.

For instance if i launch "df" i see that the flash disk percentage use and the 
blocks number returned are nonsense:

/ # df                                                                                        
Filesystem          1K-blocks	Used	    Available	Use%        
/dev/root            134219776	120588080  13631696	5898330%

This happens also when trying to format an USB stick. The mkfs applet tryies 
to allocate an enormous number of inodes and consequently fails.

I got the same problems with the old toolchain: renesas-2010.09-60.

Has anyone got the same issue?

Thanks

Andrea
