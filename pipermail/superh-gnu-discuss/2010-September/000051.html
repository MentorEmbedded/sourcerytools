<PRE>It seems that some versions of GCC do not handle negative constants in
inline assembly very well, specifically any negative constant less that
-129. Here is a reduced example of the problematic code,

static inline void set_bl_bit(void)
{
	unsigned long __dummy0;

	__asm__ __volatile__ (
		&quot;and	%1, %0\n\t&quot;
		: &quot;=r&quot; (__dummy0)
		: &quot;r&quot; (0xffffff0f)
		: &quot;memory&quot;
	);
}

Now, what GCC should do is place 0xffffff0f in a constant pool and load
it into a register with a mov.l instruction. What actually happens is
that GCC truncates 0xffffff0f to 16-bits (0xff0f), places it in a
constant pool and loads it with mov.w. Since the BL bit of the status
register is at bit-position 28, it doesn't even get set.

To work around this issue simply replace 0xffffff0f with 0xffffffff. It
is safe to include the IMASK field of the sr register in the 'and' mask
because we're blocking interrupts anyway by setting the BL bit, so
there's no need to disable them. The original mask was buggy anyway as
if any bits were set in IMASK we'd drop them on the floor and they'd
never be restored.

This bug was discovered after applying commit
73a38b839b9295216e8d44dabf54de88270e77b8 (&quot;sh: Only use bl bit toggling
for sleeping idle.&quot;), which made my sh7785lcr board reset after calling
local_irq_enable() in default_idle().

Paul, it may be worth letting this one bake for another -rc period in
the hope that if there are any problems, people will hit them. I am
unsure when this bug was introduced and am pretty confused about why no
one else is seeing it. It's completely reproducible for me. I've tried
both Sourcery G++ Lite 4.3-143 for SuperH GNU/Linux and Sourcery G++
Lite 4.4-200 for SuperH GNU/Linux releases.
