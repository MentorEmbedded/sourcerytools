Dear sir,

I just have my AMD64 workstation install Ubuntu 9.10 x86-64. Then I use the
same way what I install in i386 VM, but it just stop after launch the
CodeSourcery graphic screen and then return to hold on console mode. How to
resolve this problem?

I don't know why the graphical installer might not work?

I suggest you try to use the non-graphical installer, as follows, from 
the CodeSourcery knowledge base (available to registered users):

-----
You can run the installer in console mode by invoking it with the -i 
console command-line option. For example:

E:\> sourceryg++-4.2-143-arm-none-eabi.exe -i console
It takes a few moments for the installer to start up.

When running in console mode, you still have control of all installation 
parameters (such as the location where Sourcery G++ is installed).

You can also use the -i console command-line option to run the Sourcery 
G++ uninstaller in console mode.
-----------

If that doesn't work for you, then try a manual installation using the 
"IA32 GNU/Linux TAR" package from here:
   http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/superh/portal/release1041

I hope that helps

Hi Jordan,  I just successfully installed "Sourcery G++ Lite 4.4-45 for
SuperH GNU/Linux"  on my Ubuntu 9.1 x86_64 machine using the GUI Installer.
 Did you verify the MD5 Checksum of the binary you downloaded matches the
one on the download page here:
http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/superh/portal/release1041

Also, the graphical installer is incompatible with the dash shell, which is
the default on Ubuntu.  You can reconfigure to a supported shell using:

sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow dash
Install as /bin/sh? No

Let me know if you're still having problems.

Cheers
Bill

Best regards

Subject: mplayer argument parsing segfault with 4.4-45
Message-ID: <aec7e5c30912272102i83c36b3ydc7cfea3a684ebd6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm using a static mplayer to test some kernel multimedia code, and
I've ran into an issue with 4.4-45. The older 4.3-143 fails during
build. The "good" old KPIT toolchain 4.2.1-SH4-LINUX_v0702
(gnush4_linux_v0702_rc-1-1.i386.tar.gz) is however working just fine.

With 4.4-45 I can build the binary just fine, but during runtime I get
a segfault. No options are passed to the cross gcc so I assume it's
building for sh4a. To trigger a segfault pass "-tv outfmt=nv12" to
mplayer. Omitting "-tv outfmt=nv12" removes the segfault.

/ # /mplayer -tv outfmt=nv12 tv://1
Segmentation fault

I can reproduce this on real sh4a hardware and using qemu-sh (from
gentoo app-emulation/qemu-0.9.1).

Let me know if you need any additional information. Thanks!

/ magnus

Build and running instructions:

1. Get mplayer svn r30131
2. Apply the attached patch
3. Perform configure (replace _ with your prefix, use the attached
good_options-vidix file):

./configure --cc=_gcc --as=_as --ar=_ar --host-cc=gcc
--target=sh-linux --prefix=/ `cat ../good_options-vidix`

4. Run make:

make EXTRALIBS="-lpthread -lm -static"

5. Execute binary on target or in qemu-sh4

mplayer -tv outfmt=nv12 tv://1

This might indicate a compiler bug, but of course it might also indicate
a problem with mplayer.  As the compiler becomes more aggressive in
optimizing, it tends to expose more problems in existing applications.

For us to investigate this, you'll have to produce a test case that
shows what code you think is being miscompiled.  That includes:

1. Preprocessed source code (obtained with -save-temps) for the file in
question.
2. All command-line options used to compile that code.
3. Which function in the resulting object file you think has been
miscompiled and why.

Thanks,

Right, and mplayer is not exactly the most bug free piece of software around.

Thanks for the instructions. I mainly wanted to report the issue and
make it possible for someone else to reproduce it. I'd like to get rid
of the old KPIT compiler if possible and this is the only case left.

The mplayer source is fairly large so I suspect that the issue needs
to be tracked down further. Do you have any pointer to a more fine
grained step by step document that can be followed to produce these
things for you? I'm quite busy though so I'm afraid I'll just add this
to my TODO list for now.

Thanks,

/ magnus

Thanks Magnus, I was able to reproduce the segfault using your instructions.

I see if I can investigate this a little further as well.

The first technique is to mix object files between the good and bad
builds.  Build the whole thing with both compilers, but then link half
of the object files from the good build with the other half from the bad
build.  Continue to bisect things until you have a bad object file.  If
you're lucky, that's a small object file with just one or two functions
in it, and it will be obvious what's been miscompiled -- or what's buggy
 in the source code.
