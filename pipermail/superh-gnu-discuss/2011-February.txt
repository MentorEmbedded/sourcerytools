Hi Andrew,
at the I end I got my board booting linux 2.6.37 and hello world userspace 
applicaiton running properly with
gcc version 4.4.1 (Sourcery G++ Lite 4.4-206)

Two questions:
1) is this the last release of the toolchian for uclinux with FDPIC support?
2) Now I have 4 MiB of jffs2 filesystem. The libuClibc-0.9.30-svn.so is 51,1 MB 
(53583624 byte). I understand it is not possible to have dynamic linking in 
this conditions. It it true?

Thanks a lot

There is a new, updated toolchain here:

I'm not sure I fully understand the question. Are you saying that you 
can't have dynamic libraries because they are too large for your 
file-system? If so, then you may well be right, but there is still hope!

In addition to the usual things like stripping the binaries or using a 
compressed file system, you might be able to use the "mklibs" Library 
Reduction Utility to reduce the binary size.

CodeSourcery does not bundle this tool into the Lite editions, but it 
does feature in the full products (there isn't one for FDPIC, but the 
regular Linux version might work with some tweaking - I believe it just 
needs to be pointed at the correct linker/objdump tools), and of course 
you can get it from the upstream repository.

This tool removes everything from the dynamic libraries that are not 
used by the set of binaries you specify. This means that the code 
remains shared, and so reduces both run-time memory usage, and 
file-system storage space. The down-side is that you can't run arbitrary 
binaries on your system - you have to be sure they don't have additional 
symbol dependencies.

Hope that helps

Andrew

You understood properly.

With strip --debug reduce a lot the size.
sh-uclinux-strip --strip-debug
is the only opstion or I can reduce more and more with other options?

I'm not sure to understand.
mkliubs is available with sh-uclinux lite or not?
If yes where can I download it and study hiow to use it?

I believe that is all. You could strip all symbols from static binaries, 
but I think that will break dynamic ones.

mklibs is not included in the sh-uclinux package, not in any of the Lite 
releases (I believe). It is included in the sh-linux full product.

mklibs is implemented in python and uses the binutils for most of what 
it does, so will probably work. No promises though.

I'm not sure where the official upstream is, but both debian and ubuntu 
have it in their source repositories.

Thanks a lot. I understand.
But now I have problem of
sh: page allocation failure. order:8, mode:0xd0

Just for my information.
When I build a user sapce applicaito, do I need to specify the complier / 
linker I want an executable fo a MMUless machine?

Thanks in advance

That means you ran out of memory. This could be a toolchain bug, say if 
the shared memory isn't working right, but it's probably just too large 
an application.

I run busybox on my board, and nothing else but the specific application 
I need.

The Sourery G++ for SH uClinux is built specifically for an MMUless machine.

Really I have 64 MiB of SDRAM; now I have set the kernel to know that and
I will try.
Could be usefull to test the last toolchain you wrote to me?

Thanks

Oh, OK. My boards have much less (each instance of busybox takes 10%!)

Yes, if you find any problems, please let us know in the bug tracker.

Ok, Andrew.
I tesetd the latest toolchain and it works.
I set properly the ram size of my board and its works.

I go head with the develop.

Thanka a lot
