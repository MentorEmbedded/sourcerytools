Here again :)

Sorry for leaving you without an answer last time.
I got a working busybox compiling it statically and it seemed running without 
problems..the kernel booted and the init user-space process started.

It seems that the problem related to the "unaligned userspace access" error 
occurs when i compile the sources using dynamic libraries. 
Going back to your question about how did i install the libraries, i put the 
contents of the toolchain libc directory in the target standard paths (/lib 
and /usr).
Am i supposed to specify the rpath and dynamic-linker options?
Should i use other special compiler or linker flags?

Best regards

Andrea

No, that all sounds right to me. Do other dynamically linked programs 
work? Say, simple ones like hello world?

Nope.. this is what happens:
