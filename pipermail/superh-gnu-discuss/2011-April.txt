Subject: unaligned userspace access
Message-ID: <201104151057.57641.andrea.baldini@spesonline.com>

Hi all,

I'm working on a sh2a board and i tried to use your latest available 
toolchain (renesas-2010.09) to cross-compile the 2.6.35 kernel release.
When i try to boot the kernel i get a "unaligned userspace access" error. 
What could it depend on?
 
Regards
Andrea

It's hard to say what could be causing that, exactly - in my experience, 
the 'unaligned access' it's detected is usually (but not necessarily) 
merely fallout from some other error.

Unfortunately, that seems to be one of the most common failure mode I 
see. Just about any memory scribble or other kind of crash that leads to 
executing random memory as code can cause this exception.

I have not tested a 2.6.35 kernel myself, but I've no reason to believe 
it shouldn't work. You could ask about the kernel support for you target 
at linux-sh at vger.kernel.org

Presumably you're sure that the user space isn't causing the problem?

Yes, we use that board. I'm not sure what version - I don't have 
physical access to the board as it is in a remote location.

Did you build busybox with the same toolchain? You do need a busybox 
built with FDPIC to work on this target, of course.

Thanks for the quick answer.
the kernel fails when it tries to execute the first userspace application 
(that is the init script). it seems it can't execute the busybox binaries for 
some reason... did any of you try to boot a kernel in the rsk 7203 board? 
(if so which version? although, as you said, i don't think it is a problem of 
the kernel release)

thanks again

Andrea

Did you build it statically linked or dynamically linked? (If you don't 
know 'file busybox' should tell you on most Linux distros.)

If you built it to use dynamic libraries, how did you install the system 
libraries?

Subject: Compiler error for SH7045?
Message-ID: <20110415154917.GB25680@criseis.ruhr.de>


Hi everyone,

I am using this compiler:

olaf] ~/sources/SH7045/test1: sh2a-gcc --version
sh2a-gcc (GCC) 4.5.1

I made my own testboard for an old SH2 (SH7045). It is working good!
But only if I use the compile without optimization:

CFLAGS          = -O0 -m2  -Wfloat-equal -Wunused-variable -Wa,-L

When I am using this:

CFLAGS          = -O2 -m2  -Wfloat-equal -Wunused-variable -Wa,-L

or this:

CFLAGS          = -O1 -m2  -Wfloat-equal -Wunused-variable -Wa,-L

I got an CPU Adress Error interrupt when using IRQ and the I am
leaving the IRQ-Subroutine.

For example I am using an empty irq-handler:

void INT_CMT_CMI0(void) __attribute__((interrupt_handler));
void INT_CMT_CMI0(void)
{
}

When I translate it with Optimiziation s,1 or 2 like this:

sh2-gcc  -O0 -m2  -c -o ticker.o ticker.c

I got this:

 

37:ticker.c      **** }
  29                            .loc 1 38 0
  30 0004 6FE3                  mov     r14,r15
  31 0006 6EF6                  mov.l   @r15+,r14
  32 0008 002B                  rte
  33 000a 0009                  nop
  34                            .cfi_endproc
  35                    .LFE0:
  36                            .size   _INT_CMT_CMI0, .-_INT_CMT_CMI0
  37                            .align 1

and everythink is okay. My program is working!

but when I use this:

sh2-gcc  -O2 -m2  -c -o ticker.o ticker.c

37:ticker.c      **** }
  28                            .loc 1 38 0
  29 0004 6FE3                  mov     r14,r15
  30 0006 002B                  rte
  31 0008 6EF6                  mov.l   @r15+,r14
  32                            .cfi_endproc
  33                    .LFE0:
  34                            .size   _INT_CMT_CMI0, .-_INT_CMT_CMI0
  35                            .align 1

on Line 30 or 31 my controller makes an exception to CPU-Adress error.

Is this a compiler error? Is there a compiler switch I can use to
avoid this problem? It is a little bit sad to develope a huge project
with -O0.

Olaf

Sorry Olaf, CodeSourcery toolchains only target SH-4A, SH4A-DSP, and 
SH-2A. It has not been configured or tested for other SH targets.

If you require support for other SH targets please contact 
sales at codecourcery.com.

However, I believe this probably is a compiler error. I'm not familiar 
enough with SH-2 to say why, but the problem appears to be related to 
the use of delay slots on that arch? On the other hand, it could be that 
some other part of your program changing the contents of the registers 
before they get to the code you quote.

Sorry not to be more help.

Andrew

Hi

I have downloaded the
http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/superh/portal/subscription?@template=lite(GNU/Linux)
SH toolchain

and compiled a simple program for SH7712 chipset (which supports sh3/sh4
architecture) as below

using sh-linux-gnu-gcc -m3 -Wa,--isa=sh3

but I am getting "Illegal Instruction" for printing "float" value. If I
remove "float" usage then I can get the program to work

I tried -m4-nofpu & other -m flags but to no avail

#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
int num=1;
float flnum=1.0;
if(*(char *)&num==1)
printf("Little Endian %f\n",flnum);
else
printf("Big Endian %f\n",flnum);
}

Can you please suggest as to what gcc flags I need to use to make the
program work. My original app use lots of float instructions

Sorry, the CodeSourcery Lite toolchain currently only supports SH-4A.

The options you mention do allow you to compile your own code for other 
architectures (although we don't test that it produces *good* code for 
them), but there are no corresponding libraries to link against, so you 
still get SH-4A code from there - hence the illegal instructions.

If you revert back to the GCC 4.4 based Lite toolchain [1], you'll find 
that that supported SH4AL-DSP, which is essentially the same as 
-m4-nofpu, so you might get further with that.

The other toolchain editions [2] still support SH4AL-DSP, and come with 
technical support. (You can try them for 30 days, free of charge.)

If you would like CodeSourcery toolchains to support SH3, please contact 
sales at codesourcery.com.

Hope that helps

Andrew
