Subject: Problems with EABI
Message-ID: <20070528173633.owd176fcgowggsgg@webmail.tut.fi>

Hello,

I have some problems with the EABI binaries. I have recompiled the  
kernel again omitting the compatibility with old ABIs:

CONFIG_ARM_THUMB=y
CONFIG_AEABI=y
# CONFIG_OABI_COMPAT=y is not set

I am working with the board AT91RM9200-EK. I have used a glibc  
toolchain from Codesourcery. I have installed these libraries from my  
crosscompiler in the rootfs. I have also compiled and installed Busybox.

When I try to boot the filesystem, an error occurs. I can't run any  
program as init. I tried with /sbin/init and a hello-world  
application, but I obtain the same error:

Failed to execute /sbin/init.  Attempting defaults...
Kernel panic - not syncing: No init found.  Try passing init= option  
to kernel.

I don't know which the problem is. If someone managed to run EABI in  
this board or in other similar please let me know.

Regards,

Javier
