I should also mention that the GNU/Linux toolchains now include runtime 
libraries for ARMV4T -- in addition to the ARMV5T libraries provided in 
previous releases.  (The note on our web site regarding the new release 
suggested that ARMV4T libraries *replaced* ARMV5T libraries, but they 
are in fact *in addition to* the ARMV5T libraries.)

Subject: 2006q3-27 Release Now Available
Message-ID: <455B9063.6010105@codesourcery.com>

The 2006q3-27 release of the CodeSourcery GNU Toolchain for ARM
Processors is now available from:

http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/

The previous 2006q3-26 release included ARM V7M startup code that had
been built in ARM mode, rather than in Thumb-2 mode.  This error has
been corrected in the 2006q3-27 release.

Our next major release will be available approximately May 1st, 2007 and
will include a number of new features, including support for uClinux.

Enjoy!
