Subject: Updated 2008q1 uClinux Toolchains
Message-ID: <4823EC35.1090203@codesourcery.com>

We have corrected a defect in the version of the GNU Debugger included
in our 2008q1 uClinux toolchains that caused the debugger to crash when
printing global variables.

The new release is now available from:

Enjoy!
