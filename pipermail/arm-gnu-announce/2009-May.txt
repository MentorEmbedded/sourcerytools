Subject: 2009Q1 Release Available
Message-ID: <4A0DFB70.5050803@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery is pleased to announce the availability of the 2000q1 (*)
Sourcery G++ Lite Edition release for ARM processors.  This is
available for download from:

	http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm

Some of the new features in this release include:

* Improved code generation for ARMv7-A and other ARM CPUs.

* Implementation of the "backtrace" function on ARM GNU/Linux.

* The new Cortex-M0 core is supported in the ARM EABI toolchain.

* GCC has been upgraded to 4.3.3.

Refer to the Getting Started Guide (available from the download page)
for new release notes.  There are also a few notes on the download pages
about experimental optimization options that you might want to try, if
you want to try to get higher performance.  Because these options are
experimental, they're not (yet) enabled by default.

Enjoy!

(*) Yes, we know it's Q2 now. :-)

Subject: 2009Q1 Release Update for ARM GNU/Linux
Message-ID: <4A198A8E.5090205@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery is pleased to announce the availability of an update to the
2009Q1 Sourcery G++ Lite Edition release for ARM GNU/Linux systems.  (No
updates are presently planned for the EABI, uClinux, or SymbianOS releases.)

The new release is available for download from:

	http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm

The key changes in this update are:

* The "backtrace" function in GLIBC now works with dynamically-linked
binaries.  (The original 2009q1-176 release was the first to support
"backtrace" at all -- but in that release it only worked for
statically-linked binaries.)

* A compiler crash when compiling for Cortex-A9 has been fixed.

Refer to the Getting Started Guide (available from the download page)
for more detailed release notes.

Enjoy!
