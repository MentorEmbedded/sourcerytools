Subject: New SymbianOS GNU Toolchain packages available
Message-ID: <42AE2289.4010709@codesourcery.com>

At Symbian's request, we have made available an updated version 
(2005-Q1C) of the SymbianOS packages for download from:

http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/

This a bug-fix only release, including fixes for (a) a problem with 
invoking the toolchain under the CodeWarrior IDE and (b) a problem with 
using the linker options "-Tdata"  and "-Map" simultaneously.  If you're 
not encountering problems with the 2005-Q1B toolchain, there is no 
reason to upgrade.
