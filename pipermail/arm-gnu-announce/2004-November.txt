Subject: ARM GNU Toolchain 2004-Q3 Release Available
Message-ID: <418FFDC3.8090402@codesourcery.com>

The 2004-Q3 release of the CodeSourcery GNU Toolchain for ARM Processors 
is now available from:

  http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm.html

This release contains full support for the ABI for the ARM Architecture, 
much faster C++ exception-handling, and a variety of improvements for 
ARM V6.  Of course, there are a lot of miscellaneous bug fixes and other 
improvements as well.

The Symbian OS compilers are not presently included in this release, as 
Symbian is performing final validation.  We expect those compilers to be 
available very shortly.

Enjoy!
