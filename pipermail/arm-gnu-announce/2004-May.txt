Subject: Updated 2004-Q1A release 
Message-ID: <200405051758.08993.paul@codesourcery.com>

An updated release of the CodeSourcery GNU Toolchain for ARM Processors is 
available.

It can be downloaded from
http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm.html

This release is based on out 2004-Q1 release, with the addition of several 
small bug fixes. In particular it addresses incorrect code generation when 
using FPA floating point coprocessor instructions.

Some users experienced difficulties unpacking tar.gz packages on Windows 
hosts. We now provide an additional package in Zip format. The contents of 
the two packages are identical.
