Subject: ARM GNU Toolchain 2005-Q1 Release Available
Message-ID: <200505031214.28936.paul@codesourcery.com>

The 2005-Q1 release of the CodeSourcery GNU Toolchain for ARM Processors is 
now available from:

http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/

This release adds compilers targeting SymbianOS and Arm GNU/Linux, including 
NPTL (posix threads) support. All the compilers in this release are based on 
the ABI for the ARM Architecture.

In addition to the existing tools this release also contains the GNU Debugger 
(GDB). This includes an integrated simulator for running binaries produced by 
the arm-none-eabi toolchain, the ability to connect to remote debug
targets, and a utility for interfacing with ARM RDI debug targets.

The assembler now includes preliminary thumb-2 support, including the unified 
assembly syntax. This is backwards compatible with the existing arm syntax, 
and allows the same assembly code to be used for both arm and thumb-2.

Enjoy!

Paul
