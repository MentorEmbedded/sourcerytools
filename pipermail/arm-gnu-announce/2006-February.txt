Subject: RVDS assembler directive "PROC" equivalent gnu assembler required
Message-ID: <330CE84E8FEC1644B16B241D1A7C4FF976D112@BLRKECMSG01.ad.infosys.com>




Hi All,



The FUNCTION equivalent gnu assembler directive is .func.  What is the
equivalent gnu assembler directive for PROC directive?



Background:

The RVDS Assembler guide states

"Each FUNCTION directive must have a matching ENDFUNC directive. You
must not nest

FUNCTION/ENDFUNC pairs, and they must not contain PROC or ENDP
directives"



I would like to convert functions that are nested.



Thanks in Advance.



Regards,

Dheeraj
