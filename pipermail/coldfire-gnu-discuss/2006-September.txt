Subject: Compiler bug found?
Message-ID: <0FAD7C008A1FEB448725A0EFAE2A3A4A03324F07@eadsna-irvexch1.EADS-NAdefense.local>

I am presently in the process of trying to compile a linux kernel
2.6.17.10 for a coldfire variant with gcc version 4.1.0 (CodeSourcery
Freescale 4.1-14).  Unfortunately I am running into the compiler fault:

 

 

fs/proc/proc_misc.c: In function 'show_stat':

fs/proc/proc_misc.c:512: internal compiler error: in
find_reloads_address_1, at reload.c:5571

Please submit a full bug report,

with preprocessed source if appropriate.

See <URL:mailto:coldfire-gnu-discuss at codesourcery.com> for instructions.

 

I have isolated the fault to the inclusion of the <asm/div64.h> header
file.  More specifically if the following define is present in this
file, the compiler chokes:

 

#define do_div(n,base) ({
\

            uint32_t __base = (base);
\

            uint32_t __rem;
\

            __rem = ((uint64_t)(n)) % __base;
\

            (n) = ((uint64_t)(n)) / __base;
\

            __rem;
\

 })

 

If it is taken out, the linker obviously can't find "do_div" at the end
but the compiler doesn't fail.

 

Has this problem been seen before?

I'm sorry you've encountered a problem.  Thanks for reporting it.

Not that we're aware of :)

We're going to need

1) preprocessed source code (you can get this with -save-temps)
2) the exact compile options used

to investigate further.

There is an update to the coldfire toolchains scheduled for later this year.

Subject: Where to get the P&E dll?
Message-ID: <FC38D423B436F74B911D07DE0C9E6963BE4A16@IE10EV801.global.ds.honeywell.com>

Hi all,

 

I did download the drivers for Coldfire BDM from the P&E site.

In could not find dll files in the pemicro directory.

 

Should this dll be purchased from pemicro separately?

 

Thanks,

kcn

That is true for the moment.  We will be including the P&E libraries in a Fall 
update.
