 &gt; The current sprite is unable to program flash.  flash programming will
 &gt; be in our next release, scheduled for the end of March.  Debugging a
 &gt; program from flash already works -- the debugger will use hardware
 &gt; breakpoints rather than patched breakpoints.

Great!  So, I have only to find out a tool to program the internal
Flash of the M52235 MCU, and all will be up and running.
As a programing tool, I have already tryed CFFLASHER.  Sadly, this
tool seems to not work at all on some Windows XP machine !?
So, I will use the &quot;Flash Programmer&quot; tool included inside the CodeWarrior
IDE :-/  It is more complex to use, but work on all machines (I know),
and it can be configured to match custom emmbedded system.


I have 1 question...

In the past, I have been able to use Insight (for Windows) with mspgcc
(GCC for the TI MSP430 MCUs).  I had just to configure Insight to
communicate with the &quot;gdbproxy&quot; utility, and all was working fine.

Is it possible to do the same with Sourcery G++ ?
