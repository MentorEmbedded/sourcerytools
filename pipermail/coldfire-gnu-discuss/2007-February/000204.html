We are currently working on adding flash support for a variety of chips
directly to Sourcery G++.  Our initial targets are chips that implement
the Intel and AMD flash protocols.  (That is not related to the x86
instruction set; it's a protocol used for programming the flash chips.)
 Do you happen to know if the internal flash in the ColdFire chips
supports that?

Nathan, do you know if the current versions of the sprite, as provided
with the Professional Edition, support the internal flash on the
M52235EVB boards?

If not, the CFFLASHER utility from Freescale:

should be able to program the flash on these parts?

Thanks,
