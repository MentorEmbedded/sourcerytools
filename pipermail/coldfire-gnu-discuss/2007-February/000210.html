Insight is a little different from other gdb frontends, in that it is 
combined with the gdb backend.  Thus (I think) you'd need to build gdb 
for the ColdFire with Insight support.  It should be possible, but it 
might be a little scary if you haven't done it before.

There are other front ends available for gdb that can work easily with 
any backend.  I've used gvd with a number of gdb's for different 
targets, and ddd works too (although it's a bit alien on windows) - 
Eclipse works basically in this way, although Code Sourcery have added a 
bit more integration.
