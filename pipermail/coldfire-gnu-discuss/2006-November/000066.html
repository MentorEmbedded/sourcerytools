<PRE>Can anyone give me some pointers to getting board setup to work 
correctly using CodeSourcery's gdb and stub?  I have two problems - I 
can't see how to set (or view) cpu space registers, and I can't get the 
stub to use my own board configuration file.

I'm used to using a older version of gdb, patched with bdm support (from 
bdm.sourceforge.net).  My board setup is done with commands in a 
.gdbinit file such as:

bdm-write-creg 0xc05 0x10000001

I can't find any way to do something similar with the CodeSourcery tools.

The cfpe-stub program appears to do a certain amount of board setup, 
based on the &quot;-t&quot; parameter.  For example, when called with 
&quot;m68k-elf-cfpe-stub -t m5213evb&quot;, creg 0xc05 (aka RAMBAR) is apparently 
set to 0x20000001.  I'd like to use my own target setup, but I can't 
find any information on the configuration file syntax (the CodeSourcery 
documentation refers to the Code Worrier documentation, but I've no 
plans to download hundreds of megabytes of Code Worrier if I can avoid 
it).  I tried using a cfg file from FreeScale's flash programmer, but 
that does not seem to work.  If anyone has an example configuration 
file, I expect I can figure out what changes I'd need for my own use.

mvh.,

David
