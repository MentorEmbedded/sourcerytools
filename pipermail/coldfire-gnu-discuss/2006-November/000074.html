That would be fine for me.  I use gdb scripts and batch programming on 
other cards - it's easy to combine card test and programming setups for 
production use with gdb scripts.

&gt;&gt;<i> On other gdb + proxy setups I have used, the &quot;monitor&quot; command is used 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to pass commands directly to the proxy program, and as far as I know 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is done without changes to gdb.  The msp430 proxy program, for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example, handles commands like &quot;monitor erase&quot; to erase the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> microcontroller's flash.  That would perhaps be an easier route to add 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality than implementing bdm specific commands in gdb.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but it's somewhat limited, and doesn't scale well e.g. to IDEs;
</I>&gt;<i> it's our goal to support both command line and IDE development well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike a lot of people developing board support, CodeSourcery has the
</I>&gt;<i> ability and motivation to improve GDB instead of short-circuiting
</I>&gt;<i> around it - and in this specific case we have a thorough plan for
</I>&gt;<i> access to board specific registers.  Implementation is still in
</I>&gt;<i> progress, though!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Sometimes short-cuts are easiest, and sometimes it is best to spend the 
time and effort doing a full job to make life easier later.  I use gcc 
toolchains on a range of targets, and it is often annoying that embedded 
target features like interrupts or debugging peculiarities are different 
for every target instead of having a common solution.  Since there is a 
perfectly workable hack for this issue (putting the code on the stack is 
a nice idea), I have no problems with waiting for you guys to implement 
a more complete solution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the meantime you could include a function of the form
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> void set_cache_debug (unsigned v) {
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  __asm__ __volatile__ (&quot;movec.l %0,%/cacr&quot; :: &quot;r&quot; (v) : &quot;memory&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in your application and use it from gdb with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (gdb) call set_cache_debug(0xWHATEVER)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, that's what I had planned to do (although I had thought of setting 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up such functions from within my .gdbinit file rather than in the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> program being debugged).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If nothing else, you can probably combine these two plans.  This is not
</I>&gt;<i> a general or elegant solution, mind you, just a temporary hack, but the
</I>&gt;<i> GDB trick may be useful if you need it.  This is the same principle
</I>&gt;<i> many JTAG interfaces use, though they have better ways to do it than
</I>&gt;<i> the stack, and this only works once the stack and memory are set up...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # Untested
</I>&gt;<i> define set_cacr
</I>&gt;<i> set $sp = $sp - 16
</I>&gt;<i> set {short}$sp = 0x1111 # movec.l...
</I>&gt;<i> set {short}($sp+2) = 0x2222 # ...%d0, %cacr
</I>&gt;<i> set {short}($sp+4) = 0x4444 # ret
</I>&gt;<i> set $p = (void (*) (int)) $sp
</I>&gt;<i> call $p($arg1)
</I>&gt;<i> set $sp = $sp + 16
</I>&gt;<i> end
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
