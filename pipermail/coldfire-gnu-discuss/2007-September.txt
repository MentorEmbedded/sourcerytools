Subject: [coldfire-gnu-discuss] Usage of shared libraries
In-Reply-To: <20070830202358.GK2415@lios>
Message-ID: <EC5EE493B6046F45A2DDEC4A828DE52E021DD1A1@EXCHSRVR.syntech.org>

I attempted to create a shared library according to the new method on pg
11 of the guide. I believe that the endianness of the data_end and
data_start in the flat_hdr is causing a large negative size (0xffffffe4
or something). So I abandoned that method and tried the old way.

I've tried using the old/uClibc method to get this working.
Unfortunately, I am getting an "Illegal Instruction" on the load of the
flat file. Do you have a working example for a small "hello world"
shared library using either the new or old method? Thanks.

The recommended way to create shared libraries for CodeSourcery's
Sourcery G++ toolchains is documented in the "Getting Started" guide.
More specifically Chpater 3, Section 2, "Shared Libraries" page 10.

Does anyone know?

As far as I know this is not fixed in the latest uClibc. Please see
Chapter 3, Section 2.4, "Symbol Binding." uClibc doesn't follow normal
ELF symbol resolution and the threads errno cannot be updated. 

The simplest workaround is not to use shared libraries and pthreads.

Cheers,
Carlos.

I'm sorry, we don't have a worked example available.  We do use the scheme 
documented in the guide to build and test the shared libc provided in the 
distribution.

Message-ID: <7CDB5C938E142249AC05F6EF554DC766062E9385@EXCHANGEVS01.vms.ad.varian.com>

I am working with the P&E parallel cable and have installed the supplied
drivers from CodeSourcery.
Unable to debug.
Getting the following:
 
C:\Projects\helloworld_mcf523x\src>m68k-elf-sprite -i

pe: [speed=<n:0-31>&memory-timeout=<n:0-99>] P&E Adaptor

  pe://ParallelPortCable:1 - LPT1 : Parallel Port 1 (Address $0378)
ccs: [timeout=<n>&speed=<n>] CCS Adaptor
  ccs://$Host:$Port/$Chain_position - CCS address
 
When I try to debug:

Why is the sprite trying to open the P&E CycloneProMaxSerial port 1 ?
(instead of the known ParallelPort on address $0378)
Additionally I get a dialog box indicating that there is a driver update
for the CycloneProMaxSerial  going on (and finally fails)!!
 
so, trying to configure the correct adapter with the whole descriptor
instead of just pe:

here things are getting even more wired. I get a dialog box saying "The

memory could not be "read"."
Looks like a null pointer access in the driver.
 
Any ideas / suggestions welcome

This shows that the pe library has detected two P&E devices.  You can use the 
URLs it lists to select devices unabiguously.

You've given the URL 'pe:', therefore the first reported p&e device that matches 
will be selected.  As you can see from the above -i output, that will be the 
cyclonepromaxserial.  Use 'pe://ParallelPortCable:1' to explicitly select your 
parallel port device.

Do you have a cyclonepromaxserial connected?

Can you try with
   target remote | m68k-elf-sprite -v pe://ParallelPortCable m5235evb
That will provide more logging information.

No, there is no connection at all on my COM1 port

I have a Edgeport USB to 4x serial converter on a USB port connected for
getting terminal output from the board. May this cause the trouble ?

I do not know why the P&E library is detecting something on COM1 then.  It's 
possible that it is not possible to autodetect this device, so it is listed as 
present in order for you to be able to select it.

Ah, I think I recognize that.  If so, it will be fixed in the Fall release, 
which will be released next week.

Yes, the serial and parallel devices are always listed.  There's no
way to detect them without writing to the respective ports, and that
could be bad if something else was plugged in.
