Yes, I think you are correct about this. We investigated further and
found that SP gets set to 0x40102700 which does not exist. This occurs
randomly. We are in an endless loop which does nothing but increment a
counter. Sometimes we reach just one iteration, sometimes 10 or more.

After we jump to the adress, we end up in the exception handler but
never get out, because we hit this adress over and over again.

Maybe this is some sort of timing problem, as we can nearly go through
the whole application if we use single line stepping in the debugger.

I attached the initialisation file for the board. I tried reducing the
stack size as suggested, but this did not help either.

Regards,

Kevin
