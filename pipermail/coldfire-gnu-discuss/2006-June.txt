Thanks for the report.  We have a release scheduled for the end of June
that will include a fix for this problem.

Subject: coldfire 5407 with P&E micro BDM
Message-ID: <B73A3EBC65974349B2B3D7A6A7F2361D02EC78AF@exchange3.prg.com>

Hello,
I am trying to get the CodeSourcery GNU toolchain gdb to work with my P&E micro BDM.
 
I would be interested in purchasing the full package 
I am getting the following error when I start up gdb with the following command line:
 
>m68k-elf-gdb Node.srec
GNU gdb 6.4.50.20060226-cvs

This GDB was configured as "--host=i686-mingw32 --target=m68k-elf"...
 
(gdb) target remote | m68k-elf-cfpe-stub -t Node.ld -s 3
Error:  Could not load P&E DLL
Remote debugging using | m68k-elf-cfpe-stub -t Node.ld -s 3
(gdb) Remote communication error: Bad file descriptor.
 
 
 
I have my program compiled and linked correctly using the CodeSourcery toolchain, and I am able to use the uclinux/uClibc version of gdb to debug my board.  However, I am interested in using the CodeSourcery G++/Eclipse package if I can get it to work.
 
My P&E dll appears to be installed correctly in c:/Program Files/pemicro, and the registry looks correct as well.  Any clue as to what the "Could not load P&E DLL" problem is?
 
 
Thanks for any help,
Keith Knauber

This is just a guess -- but it might be that you need to have the
C:\Program Files\pemicro directory in your PATH.  If that doesn't help,
please post again, and we'll get it worked out.

We will be including the P&E DLL in future releases so that it will be
automatically installed.

Thanks,

Mark's suggested that the pemicro directory needs to be on the PATH. 
Alternatively you might try copying the pemicro dll to a directory that is on 
your path -- or indeed the directory containing the m68k-elf-cfpe-stub program.

Your invokation of the stub is incorrect.  The -t option does not take a linker 
script, but a board initialization configuration.  Unfortunately your 5407 board 
is not supported directly by the stub at this point.  You need to find the 
CodeWarrior configuration file, which I believe will be in

'Program\ Files/Freescale/CodeWarrior\ for\ ColdFire\ 
V6.3/E68K_Support/Initialization_Files/'

and it will be called something like MCF5407evb.cfg

Due to licensing reasons, we are currently unable to distribute those files
