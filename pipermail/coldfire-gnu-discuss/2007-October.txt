When I try to run the installer, it can never get past "Rebuilding 
Environment". I started with the newest version (4.2-8). I downloaded it 
twice and I also tried to go back one version(4.1-32). I can't seem to 
get this tool chain to install. Does anyone have a suggestion?

What are you installing it on, which toolchain are you installing and what are 
the messages you get?

Hello Nathan,

I am installing the m68-elf tool chain on Windows XP SP2. I don't get 
any error messages, but the installer has a box pop up that says 
"Refreshing Environment". Once this pops up the CPU usage for the 
installer drops to 0 and occasionally goes to 1 but then right back to 
0. I let in run like this for over an hour, but the only thing to change 
was the memory usage went up by a megabyte or so. There was no change in 
the installer's status.

This has been fixed in the upcoming lite release. 

The workaround is to make sure you have closed all of your applications
before starting the installer.

Cheers,
Carlos.

Message-ID: <EC5EE493B6046F45A2DDEC4A828DE52E021DD225@EXCHSRVR.syntech.org>

I have been having some trouble with shared libraries using Codesourcery
4.2-8 for Coldfire, and I'm starting to think that it's because I have
an older version of uClibc (0.9.27). I would like to know what version
or SVN snapshot of it you have been using.

The version of uClibc in 4.2-8 is also based on 0.9.27.  However, it's
possible that your installed version is configured differently, or that
the compiler used to build it was incompatible with our 4.2-8 release.
Certainly, we recommend that you use the uClibc we provide.

Thanks,

Which kernel was the uClibc compiled against? Do you have the uClibc
source available? I could not find it inside of the source tarball.

The Linux kernel and the uClibc sources are both included in the source
tarball.  (That's how I answered your question about versions; I
untarred the source tarball and looked at the files.)

Message-ID: <6bc01b0f0710232147o77bea27pa6939bbe6bb4cd13@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I got the same problem.

Looking for place where make get it's path I found:

GCC_DIR = $(shell $(CC) -print-search-dirs | grep install: | sed
's/install://')

In my case this fails because my system is installed in spanish, so "grep
install" must be changed by "grep instalar".

That does the trick! Linux 2.4.x works just great!

Hope this works for you

Regards
