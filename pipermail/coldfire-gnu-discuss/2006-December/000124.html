<PRE>Hello Nathan,

 &gt; 1) you had already installed P&amp;E drivers before installing SourceryG++ Lite?
 &gt;
 &gt; 2) Did the SourceryG++ install also install P&amp;E drivers (you'd've got a
 &gt;    popup window about that, if it did)
 &gt;
 &gt; 3) Did the P&amp;E driver install (either #1 or #2) request a restart?
 &gt;

- I have installed Sourcery G++ Lite first.

- During the installation, I did not see any popup window telling that
   P&amp;E driver was installed.  Maybe, I was looking away at that moment !?

- There was no request to restart the computer, and I did not restart it.

- Not seeing anything telling that P&amp;E driver was installed, I decide to
   install it from the supplyed P&amp;E disk that come with the M52235EVB box.

- There was no request to restart the computer, and I did not restart it.

- Once this driver was installed, I connected the USB Multilink for ColdFire
   to the computer, and have followed the Windows New Hardware Detected
   wizard.

- There was no request to restart the computer, and I did not restart it.

- From that point, I compiled a little project and connected to the
   target using GDB.
   From GDB, when executing a &quot;load&quot; command, there was error(s), and I
   have to make many &quot;load&quot; to finally have the command work correctly.
   I tryed also to exit GDB, re-execute GDB.  Also disconnect/re-connect the
   USB Multilink without success.

- After I have done a Poweroff and Poweron (the following day), all
   was working like a charm !


Remark:

- This morning, I installed Sourcery G++ Lite on another (Windows XP Pro)
   computer, and I saw a popup window telling that P&amp;E driver was installed.
   There was no request to restart the computer.
   I have not the USB Multilink for Coldfire here, so I can not test
   if the installed driver is functionnal.


Regards,

Claude.
