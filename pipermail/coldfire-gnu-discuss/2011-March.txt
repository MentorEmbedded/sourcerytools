Subject: linker scrpit for bare 5206e
Message-ID: <20110318121704.311240@gmx.net>

Hi everyone!

I just try to get a simple test run on my bare 5206e with 128K Flash connected (toggle the GPIO). It seems that the Hard Reset Phase does something buggy in the MBAR (write to chip-select register). So I have to skip this phase.
Does anyone have a linker script which does it? I'm  bit stuck in this problem...

Greetings

Frank

Subject: How to cross compile the OpenSSL libaray by using Sourcery G++ Lite
 for ColdFire uClinux
Message-ID: <5936A2CCC9D5ED4DB9269D6D1251AB5FBA52988630@NBE-MBX01.americas.swk.pri>

I need to generate openssl library files ?libcrypto.a? and ?libssl.a?.

I am using Sourcery G++ Lite for ColdFire uClinux and CodeWarrior for ColdFire Linux v2.5 on a Windows machine.  

I could not find any instruction about how to cross compile OpenSSL libaray by using Sourcery G++.    Is there  any instruction for it?

Thanks for your help in advance.
