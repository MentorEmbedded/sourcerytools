Subject: Problem compiling U-Boot with Codesourcery 4.4-54/4.4-217
Message-ID: <63056535ADCF774B87D41A999D9A7F2B16518D51@BCT1E2K301.americas.tsp.ad>

Hi,

 

I've  tried both the new 4.4 toolchain for coldfire GNU/Linux (4.4-54 &
4.4-217) in building my embedded system via LTIB, but when it came to
rebuilding U-Boot it complained about this line in common/main.c:

 

inline show_boot_progress (int val) __attribute__((weak,
alias("__show_boot_progress")));

 

Stating that it cannot be weak.  Of course I've tried removing the weak
and/or the inline keyword, but then my u-boot does not function
properly.   I've also noticed that on other forums that this issue is
known about gcc 4.4 and why many are sticking with 4.3.  

 

I would like to know if anyone here has had the same problem, and if
this issue is being looked at?

 

GS

You need to provide the exact error message the compiler outputs.  A 
preprocessed source and the compilation line also makes it easier to 
understand what the problem is.

Subject: NPTL on 547x cpus
Message-ID: <201005141508.26421.luigi.mantellini@idf-hit.com>

Hi List,

I'm working with 547x based board and a 2.6.25 kernel (from freescale and 
patched to cover my hw). I'm still using the "old" 4.3 toolchain in order to 
see the pthread working.


Now, I'm interested to use the last 4.4-217 in order to use the nptl 
implementation, but unfortunately the pthread seems to be broken.

Using a debugger it seems that some register is lost in the thread 
switching... but I haven't detailed information (for ttm reason I cannot spend 
too much time on this debug).

Has anyone used and tested the 4.4-x toolchains? I would like to have feedback 
from cf developers

Best regards,

luigi

What do you mean by "broken"?

Did you apply the kernel patch that the Getting Started Guide mentions?

To add NPTL support to current ColdFire kernels one needs to apply one 
of the patches linked in this knowledge base entry:

We at CodeSourcery run thousands, if not not millions, tests for each 
release.  Testing of 4.4-217 release included GLIBC testsuite which has 
many tests for libpthread.

We tried the 4.4 toolchain briefly using the 2.6.25 kernel from Freescale.  We followed the instructions in the getting started guide and was able to patch the kernel without issue.  

Using the new 4.4 toolchain, our threads seemed to consume much more CPU time than if we compiled using the old 4.3 toolchain.  We're currently still using the 4.3 toolchain with the Linux 2.6.25 kernel until we find some more time in our schedule to do the switch over.

Aside from the unexplained jump in processor usage, our ~2 week evaluation didn't uncover any bugs with the 4.4 toolchain related to NPTL.

I have an heavy threaded application that uses mutexes, semaphores. The code 
generated by compiler, keeps some constants (for optimization reason) in 
registers, then are used in a infinite loop.

Using the lauterbach debugger, I noticed that the registers are not correctly 
restored returning by signal.

CONST1=...
CONST2=...
for (;;) {
 <---------- interrupted by signal ---------->
  use CONST1 
  use CONST2
  ...
}

I'm sorry but I cannot provide a better description now because I haven't 
access to debug facilities for the next days.

I applied the requested patch for the 4.4-217 and kernel 2.6.25

I know the CS releases high quality toolchains. I'm supposing that somethins 
is wrong in my kernel (I started with the 2.6.10 and I ported by hand to 
2.6.23 and .25).

I can provide my patchset for the kernel if you are interested.

best regards,

luigi

I have a guess about the jump in processor usage on thread-heavy 
applications.

Thread-local storage (TLS) and NPTL on ColdFire requires kernel support, 
e.g., to implement atomic compare-and-exchange operation.  This support 
can be delivered to applications and libraries via kernel system calls 
or via kernel vDSO.  The main difference between system calls and calls 
to vDSO is that the latter does not involve context switching, so it is 
substantially faster.  From user-space perspective, kernel vDSO acts 
just like a shared library.

Unfortunately, vDSO support for ColdFire kernel was not finished, so 
current ColdFire kernels do not provide it.  Hence the libpthread and 
other EGLIBC libraries fallback to system call interface to get required 
functionality.

FYI, I posted my complete source tree on github:

http://github.com/comio/linux-2.6.25-cf547x/tree/2.6.25-cf547x

We worked on cache handling and fec.

I hope that freescale wakes up and continues the kernel development...

Subject: How to activate TLB mapping on m548x ?
Message-ID: <AANLkTin94HvHvukY6-vlUGVeRFDkK70a87gvewYKm5e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to activate the TLB mapping in the m548x linux kernel with
the following patch


arch/m68k/coldfire/head.S
====================
/*  ACR0 - System Registers
 *    0xF000 0000   ACR_BA     Base Address
 *    0x000F 0000   ACR_ADMSK  Address Mask
 *    0x0000 8000   ACR_E      Enable the ACR bits
 *    0x0000 2000   ACR_S=1    Dont care accesses are supervisor-only
 *    0x0000 0000   ACR_AMM    Address mode mask
 *    0x0000 0040   ACR_CM=2   Cache-inhibited, precise
 *    0x0000 0008   ACR_SP     Supervisor only
 *    -----------
 *    0xF00F A048
*/
#define ACR0_DEFAULT	#0xF00FA048   /* System Regs */
#define ACR1_DEFAULT	#0x000FA028   /* SDRAM data chache copy-back */
#define ACR2_DEFAULT	#0x00000000   /* Not mapped */
#define ACR3_DEFAULT	#0x000FA028   /* SDRAM code cache copy-back */





just before activating the MMU, a TLB zone is created, using 1MB
pages, the maximum size
Coldfire can support.
/* create 8MB dma memory mirror TLB mapping */
	mmu_map (CONFIG_DMA_BASE + 0*1024*1024), (CONFIG_SDRAM_BASE +
0*1024*1024), 0, 0, \
		MMUTR_SG, MMUDR_SZ1M, MMUDR_DNCP, MMUDR_SP, MMUDR_R, \
		MMUDR_W, 0, MMUDR_LK, %d0

Q: Is it O.K. that the mmu_page is MMUDR_DNCP and the ACR is  data
chache copy-back ?


include/asm-m68k/cf_pgalloc.h
=======================
-struct page *page = alloc_pages(GFP_DMA|__GFP_REPEAT, 0);
+struct page *page = alloc_pages(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_REPEAT, 0);

Q: Is it O.K. to replace GFP_DMA with GFP_KERNEL ? I think it's not since
the kernel will not allocate new PTE entries in the zone created in head.S.
I tried this instead:
+struct page *page = alloc_pages(GFP_DMA|GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_REPEAT, 0);
but the board hanged, and this made me think of a cache de-synchronization.

Can anyone please help ? Freescale doesn't show any willingness in
offering support.

Many thanks

Subject: m5272, gdb/gdbserver and uClinux/pthreads... again
Message-ID: <AANLkTimpv_xHAkDbqJ3NSo6SjPBVV95z5iFpgchYpJ65@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Back in march 8th I inquired about pthread debugging under uClinux using
gdbserver and Maxim and I had a brief discussion on the topic(you could look
up the thread on codesourcery website). I believe his stance was that it
should work. I tested again using the brand new 4.4-216, but I am still
unsuccessful debugging pthread apps under uclinux.
Recap; this used to work using uclinux 2007 and CodeSourcery 4.2. Now with
newer kernel/distro and newer toolchain, it doesn't work; once doing 'target
remote' from host, gdbserver bails out. Also, debugging non-threaded apps
works perfectly.

BTW, I am using the uClinux distro from uclinux.org.

Some other postings on the mailing lists got me wondered;
- Is there anything in the kernel configuration that is required for
debugging pthreads?

Does anyone had any success doing this kind of debugging?

Thanks in advance,
Harry

FWIW, we test our toolchains against LTIB rootfs.

Can you provide a simple testcase that uses pthreads and debugging which 
does not work?

Thank you,

Thanks for the reply,
I haven't been able to find a uClinux distro on freescale website. Would you
by any chance have a link to that LTIB?

Example:
I attached a very simple app that uses pthreads. I compile this with
'-mcpu=5272 -g3 -pthread' and link this to 'jth'
I pick up 'gdbserver' from
freescale-coldfire-4.4//m68k-uclinux/libc/m5206e/usr/lib. And I copy them to
jffs2 file system on the board.
Now I simply run it like:
> ./gdbserver :5555 ./jth
And from host I connect with (with gdb from same compiler as used above
compiling the source)
$ m68k-uclinux-gdb jth.gdb
..
target remote IP:5555

Now the instance I connect, the gdbserver bails out saying that it couldn't
find 'inferior'. I believe this is a thread thing.

I can however:
- debug a non thread program with the above scheme
- without the debugger, run 'jth' correctly

Let me know if I can provide further details about the test case

Harry

Subject: __ctype_ptr__ in .data (RAM)?
Message-ID: <4BF5818E.29872.B623EF67@list_ob.gmx.net>

Hello All,

(Sourcery G++ Lite 4.4-52) version 4.4.1 (m68k-elf)

Is there a special reason to have __ctype_ptr__ in .data?

BTW, regarding this line in ctype.h: 
  extern	__IMPORT _CONST char	*__ctype_ptr__;
Is "__IMPORT" defined anywhere else than in config.h?

TIA,

Oliver
