Hello, 
Does the next version of SCG++ lite will can write to flash? 
Is there an external tool on linux that can do it? 

Thanks,

Subject: m5329 compiling and linking questions
Message-ID: <74DEA4DCF5979F4CB7661A427E85E983F542FFF3@ATHENA.koncar-institut.local>

I have COBRA5329 board and I am a bit new to embedded programming
so few questions

When I compile my source with

m68k-uclinux-gcc  -mcpu=5329  -Wl,-elf2flt  -o exec_file file
I get working executable

When i do it with
m68k-uclinux-gcc -o obj_file -c file
&
m68k-uclinux-ld -L(to m5329 libc.a) -elf2flt -o exec_file obj_file

It gives 'Illegal instruction' error on target, acctualy it doesn't work with any libc library i select or with -msep-data or -mid-shared-library options
What is the catch? What happens when I use -mcpu option and auto-link file to compiler differently then when i do it manually?

ALSO

I get 'Unable to mmap process text, errno 12' a lot of times and it shouldn't be free memory problem
because my buddyinfo gives
"Node0, zone Normal 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0"

It happens with any application that i compile with -msep-data option, even for those with few kBs in size
Is something wrong with my linker scripts (tried default and some changes it didn't work)?
Could it be that fault is in msep-data libraries?

Don't try to use ld directly.  We strongly recommend using GCC to
link.

If you want to see what it's doing behind the scenes, you can add -v
to the compiler command line.
