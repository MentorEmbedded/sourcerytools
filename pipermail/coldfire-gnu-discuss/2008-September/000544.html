<PRE>Hia,

I am debugging a M52233DEMO board using the P&amp;E USB BDM.  I connect to it via m68k-elf-sprite.  I turned on the verbose console and put the sprite in verbose mode, and here's the problem I'm experiencing.

Usually debugging will work fine for a while.  I will be able to continue, suspend, step, break, and continue again without problems.  After leaving the program running for a while (a couple minutes) or doing a lot of stepping (anywhere, not in one particular place) I will experience the following.  

If the code was running and I try to do a suspend, m68k-elf-sprite uses a lot of CPU and doesn't respond.  Eventually GDB times out with &quot;Target request failed: Failed to interrupt&quot;.  During this there is no response on the console.

If I was stepping through the code when the problem happened, I will see the following on the console:
m68k-elf-sprite: Step at 0x0
m68k-elf-sprite: error: Lost connection to hardware device
m68k-elf-sprite: Sent response: 'E.fatal.Lost connection to hardware device'
Error from remote target: Lost connection to hardware device

I should also note that occasionally (about 1/5th of the time) when programming my board using CF Flasher, it will hang, timeout, fail validation and need to be flashed again.  Flashing again works fine.  I have tried disconnecting all of my USB devices, using a different USB port, and killing all background processes and services to no avail.  Any advice is sincerely appreciated.

Thank you very much,
--Matt
