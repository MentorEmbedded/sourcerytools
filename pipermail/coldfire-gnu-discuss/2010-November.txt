Am not sure what may be causing the problem as I don't have an M52223EVB 
board handy to test.  Below are a couple of theories though:

1. Double initialization.

The board is being initialized twice in your setup.  The reset sequence 
which is part of the binary image does the first initialization and the 
sprite executes initialization for the second time using commands from 
the board file.

You can try attaching the sprite to the running board without resetting 
and initializing the board, there is the "-a" sprite command-line option 
for that.  You can add a spinning loop at the beginning of your main() 
to avoid the program running away before you attach to it.

2. The binary image is written incorrectly.

I suggest you try an evaluation copy of SourceryG++ for ColdFire ELF and 
use the SourceryG++ Sprite to program the flash.

Message-ID: <SNT140-w399D3C0B4627816E362A0891360@phx.gbl>


When I used the example in "the getting started document" and complied from the command line w/ the source code file in the C:\CodeSourcery\Sourcery G++ Lite\bin folder, the compilation went smoothly.  However if I move the source code file to any location higher to the c:\ the compilation will fail.  Below are the command line input and output.

C:\CodeSourcery\Sourcery G++ Lite>m68k-elf-gcc -g -mcpu=5208 -T m5208evb-ram-hos
ted.ld main.c -o factorial
m68k-elf-gcc: CreateProcess: No such file or directory

The environment variable is set up correctly as show below.

C:\CodeSourcery\Sourcery G++ Lite>m68k-elf-gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: m68k-elf
Configured with: /scratch/maxim/cf-2010q1-lite/src-e...
...ite/obj-elf/tools-i686-pc-linux-gnu-4.4-215-m68k-elf-i686-mingw32/m68k-elf/bin
Thread model: single
gcc version 4.4.1 (Sourcery G++ Lite 4.4-215)

Any help with setting up a project environment outside the CodeSourcery installation would be appreciated.

It looks like your installation of Sourcery G++ might have been corrupted.  Did you move the Sourcery G++ folder after installation?  Can you try uninstalling Sourcery G++ and then reinstalling it into a different location?

Are any additional SSL libraries gained with an upgrade to G++ Standard or Professional? If no additional SSL libraries are gained, then are the OpenSSL libraries the only ones available for the Coldfire 5272? Anyone use any other SSL/TSL libraries on the Coldfire platform?

I've used axTLS [1] for mini_httpd to make it https ready.

You could also look at yaSSL. I have not used it, but I just recently
heard about it.

Subject: Using interrupts on the coldfire
Message-ID: <SNT140-w1CE20CB272FD356DCABE291230@phx.gbl>


Hi:

After using your getting started and the list archives, I am no closer to using interrupts than when I started.  I am sorry to say but the getting started documentation is very lacking.

Please assist me in overriding the vector table and creating the syntax for an isr.

I have a attached the example application that I used along with the map file.

In one configuration I do not add the vectors.c as an include to the main.c file and everything compiles but there is no reference to the isr in the map file within the interrupt table.  And the table in the application does not override the default table.

The second configuration I used, I added the vectors.c as an include and the compiler returned an error which is included in the commandline.txt

I am using m68k-elf-gcc versions 4.4-215 on Windows XP32bit


Thanks

Art

Message-ID: <8B5DA2CA4C03704EA1D8B301C46899F8059BCAE71F@MANEXHCM01.is.ad.igt.com>

I'm trying to get compilation and linking working with our internal build system which uses many batch files etc for this process. I have managed to get a compilation to work but have a problem when linking. The code is built on a windows platform.

The batch files use the following:-
                m68k-elf-ld  --oformat srec -o myfile.lx1 -Map myfile.mp1 -cref -T myfile.lk1

                Which gives many "undefined reference to `_myfunc'" problems.

If I use
                m68k-elf-ld  -o myfile.lx1 -Map myfile.mp1 -cref -T myfile.lk1

                I get "undefined reference to `_memcpy'" and other gcc library functions.

                Does anyone know why changing the output format would do this?

Thanx Doug

You should link with the compiler e.g. m68k-elf-gcc  -o myfile.lx1
-Wl,-Map,myfile.mp1 -Wl,-cref ?T myfile.lk1

It will add all the required libraries.

Cheers,
Carlos.
