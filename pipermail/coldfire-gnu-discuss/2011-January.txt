Subject: Debug sprite and Windows 7 64 bit
Message-ID: <060595056B95414588AA60C227DF5BEAD82630A955@MAIL.grange.local>

Hi

I am unable to make the debug sprite work with a P&E micro USB Multilink BDM module under Windows 7 64 bit. I have installed the freescale-coldfire-2010.09-39-m68k-elf build of the tools and asked for the P&E drivers to be installed but m68k-elf-sprite -i cannot find the USB Multilink device. I have the same Multilink device working with Windows XP 32 bit.

Do you expect this configuration to work? If so, can you offer any suggestions for trouble shooting?

Many thanks.,

Paul.

We are aware that the P&E drivers currently shipped with Sourcery G++ do not 
work on Windows 7 hosts.  The newer Version 10 drivers available for download on 
P&E's web site work with Windows 7 32-bit hosts, but we've had a number of 
reports that the Sprite doesn't work on Windows 7 64-bit even with the new 
drivers.  We're planning to investigate as soon as we can get hardware set up.

For now the only workaround seems to be to use the Sprite on a system running 
some other version of Windows, or inside a VM running an older version of Windows.

I believe that you need both the new driver installer from P&E and an
updated unit_cfz.dll file.  I'm not sure whether that's downloadable
from the P&E web site or whether you need to contact P&E support for
the latest version; we'll be packaging a newer version with Sourcery
G++ in a future release.

Thanks Dan,

I have made progress. A more up to date version of unit_cfz.dll can be downloaded from P&E with the latest Testcfz application. With this file in c:\windows\sysWOW64 and the latest driver from P&E, the debug sprite from the last release can find the USBMultilink cable.

Cheers,

Paul.

Subject: How to build NewLib for cpu32 (68030)

Is it possible to rebuild newlib for cpu32 (68030) processor, and if so could someone point me at some info on how to do this. We use the coldfire side, but I would like to be able to also support an older device.
