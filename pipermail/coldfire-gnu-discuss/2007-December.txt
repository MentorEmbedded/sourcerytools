The interrupt vector examples are located in Chapter 3 of the Getting
Started guide. Please tell me if you still have any questions after
reading through the chapter.

Cheers,

Kudos to expect team,

I am trying to build my own custom Coldfire compiler from the
CodeSourcery sources. Can someone please help me in succeeding in this
task? I won a Motorola Coldfire board on which I want to try it.

I am running a Windows XP operating system. I downloaded the sources for
http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/coldfire
With ColdFire ELF, IA32 Windows options enabled. The packages did not
contain any build procedure with it.

I tried to look in some groups and found that either Cygwin or MigGW is
needed to compile/run gcc in windows. I goggled further for GCC colfire
toolchain building document and could find one for NT.
http://sca.uwaterloo.ca/coldfire/ftp/davidf/coldfire/building-gcc-win32.
htm
It looks a bit old. Can I find a better link targeting WinXP Host?
The gcc tarball I downloaded seems to have more packages than listed in
the document.

Also, what would be a better option if I want to run GCC on windows:
Is it the Cygwin or the MigGW?

Regards,
Mukund Jampala

You do not need to rebuild from source.  The lite release provides binaries that 
  run on windows.
