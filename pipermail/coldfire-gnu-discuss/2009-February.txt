Dave,

Have you tried using the debugger?  You can start your program on the 
target under gdbserver and then connect it from the host using gdb, then 
you can place a breakpoint on the last instruction that executes fine, 
continue your program execution to get to the breakpoint and then step 
several instructions until the crash occurs.  This should at least tell 
you on which instruction the crash occurs.

Subject: floating point instructions enabled by default for gcc-4.3-43 on mcf5472 processor?
Message-ID: <0384B41A03232C45B676D09A0173AB1E0293412C@cdskitexg01.cds.int>

I was wondering if anyone could tell me an easy way of determining
whether or not code generated using the gcc-4.3-43 toolchain is
generating hardware floating point instructions...

 

I'm pretty sure it is, and I think I can go through the objdump of my
code but being able to draw up a list of defaults that the compiler is
using would be great.

 

Ken.

It depends on -mcpu= setting: if selected CPU has FPU unit (which, I 
believe, at the moment are only devices from 547x/548x family) then FP 
instructions can be generated.

There is also option -msoft-float that unconditionally turns off use of 
FP instructions.

Thanks for advice Maxim, our builds are currently omitting any type of
-mcpu flag so that has me wondering even more which default flags I'm
compiling with. :)

I'll setup the mcpu flag correctly today and see if the generating
objects differ significantly from my usual build.

If anyone else has any advice about how to figure out what the default
flags are for the toolchain, I'm all ears.

Thanks,

Ken.

Default -mcpu= setting depends on target you use; e.g., it's -mcpu=m5475 
for m68k-linux and -mcpu=5206 for m68k-elf.

One way to figure out precisely which compiler flags are being used is 
to let gcc compile a simple file with '-v' option and then inspect 
command line for cc1.  Gcc is actually a driver that invokes compiler 
(cc1) and/or assembler (as) and/or linker (ld) depending on the 
parameters given.

I followed your advice, and everything is exactly as you said it would
be.  In other words, we are compiling for the 5475 cpu by default.

Thanks Maxim!

Ken.
