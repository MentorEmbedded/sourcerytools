Subject: Freescale M5235EVB libraries - what clock frequency is set ?
Message-ID: <2FEBA2F4E0DB1F4281C27A80E839844305CAAC3325@PA-EX-MBXVS03.vms.ad.varian.com>

Hi,

I wonder which clock frequency is set in the libraries supplied with CodeSourcery Lite 2010.09-39 for the processor.
I'd like to use the UART for terminal output, hence I've overridden the write() function and are using unhosted linker prm files.
I get some weird output on the serial line, no standard baud rate matches. My app assumes a clock frequency of 75 MHz.

Is there any more description or documentation of the supplied libraries for:
libcs3, libcs3unhosted and libcs3coldfire ?

I am using TBLCF interface with
target remote | m68k-elf-sprite tblcf://:0/ m5235evb

Thanks,
Christof

You can check this kind of details in the initialization sequence, which is in the board .xml file; see <install_path>/m68k-elf/lib/boards/m5235evb.xml.  In M5235EVB case, init sequence does not do anything to set the clock rate, so the frequency is what the board sets on reset.

Subject: how to debug a ROM resident application ?
Message-ID: <2FEBA2F4E0DB1F4281C27A80E839844305CAAC3AB8@PA-EX-MBXVS03.vms.ad.varian.com>

Hi,

Using Windows host, Sourcery G++ Lite 2010.09-39 and TBLCF. Can happily debug RAM targets.

Now trying to debug a ROM resident application flashed on a BCC5235 eval board (it is working as printf() output on a serial line confirms)
I wonder about the correct initialization sequence for doing this

I am starting gdb with my (*.elf) executable as parameter and then issue the following initialization commands:

target remote | m68k-elf-sprite tblcf://:0/ m5235evb
load

then I get:

target remote | m68k-elf-sprite tblcf://:0/ m5235evb
m68k-elf-sprite: Target reset
0xffe00b76 in uart0_out_char (ch=83 'S') at io.c:23
23          while (!(MCF_UART_USR0 & MCF_UART_USR_TXRDY))
load
m68k-elf-sprite: Flash programming is unsupported in this release
Error erasing flash with vFlashErase packet

I had expected that the debugger loads the symbol table only and does not try to program the flash.

Is there a means to force to load symbol table only?

I have tried to use gdb's symbol-file command with *.elf file as argument instead of load w/o success (symbols are not found)

Thanks,
Christof

Don't use `load` just use `set $pc = <Entry point address>`, and ensure 
that your flashed your application via another method.

The debugger has already loaded the symbol table if you specified a 
binary as an option to gdb or used `file <binary>`.

Cheers,
Carlos.

Subject: SDRAM 16Mx4x4 and MCF5307
Message-ID: <20110419125911.142740@gmx.net>

Hello everyone,

I just try to connect the MT48LC64M4A2 SDRAM (16 Meg x 4 x 4 banks) to
my 5307.
I want to use 8 Chips (each with 4 bit data bus). How do I have to
connect and initialise it? The coldfire Init-Tool seems to be confused
with this configuration.
It shows the following config:

ColdFire Pin:    A15 A14 A13 A12 A11 A10 A9 A17 A19 A21 A23      A24 A25
A26 A27
SDRAM Pin:       A0  A1  A2  A3  A4  A5  A6 A7  A8  A9  A10(CMD) BA0 BA1
BA2 BA3

But I only have 4 Banks (BA0 and BA1)! I use 11 Bit column adress A0..9
+ A11. Portsize is 32 Bit.
Where is my fault?

Greetings

Frank
