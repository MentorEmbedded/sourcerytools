<PRE>Hi Nathan,

Thanks for you help.  You were correct in being suspicious of my data
initialisation.  I had an offset problem in my linker control file that was
causing the data and BSS sections to be 1k further along in memory than they
should have been. (My mistake as I'd marked the vector RAM table as NOLOAD)

The reason I didn't pick this earlier was because my comparison routines
used the markers in the linker control file that I had exported which were
in the addresses that were 1k further along.  

Again, your help was greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Daniel

This suggests to me that the data segment is not being correctly initialized
-- 
how have you verified that?

Have you checked that this program:

static int j = 5;

int main ()
{
   return 0;
}

... has the expected value in j when you're in main?

&gt;<i> I guess it is worth asking exactly what libraries I should be linking

</I>&gt;<i> there are libraries underneath certain folders: eg. m5208, m5213, etc.  As

</I>&gt;<i> CodeSourcery/m68k-elf/lib/m5213 with no success.
</I>
These different libraries are known as multilibs.  Each directory is tuned
for a 
different set of coldfire cores and is selected automatically by the
compiler. 
All you need to provide is the -mcpu=52235 option, and it will map it onto
the 
right set.  You can use the -v option to see exactly what is passed to the
linker.
