</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you :)  The toolchains we provide have the ColdFire patches  
</I>&gt;<i> ported to stable GCC branches (4.1 is the current release, and 4.2  
</I>&gt;<i> is arriving shortly). Mainline FSF has the ColdFire changes and  
</I>&gt;<i> those will work their way into 4.3. In addition, we validate the  
</I>&gt;<i> binaries we provided by building them in a controlled environment  
</I>&gt;<i> and running the testsuites on a variety of target boards.
</I>Does that include the NetBurner modules?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm a Mac SW engineer and have many years of ObjC experience, and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many Mb of source code, some of which I'd like to reuse in an  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> embedded project I'm working on. I'd like to see a ColdFire  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development and debug environment on Mac OS X using XCode if  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible, Eclipse if necessary. If successful it could be a boon  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Mac developers who are keen on ColdFire and want a &quot;mainstream&quot;  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> embedded solution without giving up their Macs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The SourceryG++ product includes Eclipse integration.  We're not  
</I>&gt;<i> currently supporting Mac as a host system, but would consider it if  
</I>&gt;<i> there was demand.
</I>What exactly would it take to move forward?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like to get your opinion of what might be involved in making  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this happen. I think building a toolchain should be quite doable  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on what I've read at the GCC site and your comments this  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> morning. But putting it all together with hardware (I'm thinking a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NetBurner 5282 based module) and actually getting it to work could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something I'm not prepared to do. I certainly am prepared to spend  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significant time on this, but don't want to &quot;reinvent the wheel.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It depends where you think your strengths are and what you want to  
</I>&gt;<i> spend your time on.  Do you want to develop and validate a  
</I>&gt;<i> toolchain, or do you want to write programs :)
</I>
I would consider both a good use of my time and abilities. Just how  
much time is needed, in your experience?

Best,
Andre.
