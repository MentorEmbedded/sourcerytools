<PRE>Hi Nathan,

Thanks for the answer.  I had expected them to be declared as weak but 
on checking the newlib code it appears they aren't.  I guess the answer 
I was sort of looking for was whether or not there was the opposite to a 
weak attribute (eg. a strong attribute) which causes a particular 
function to overrule any other one during the link process.. I couldn't 
see this in the docs but am happy enough with my solution at the moment...

As for thread safeness, the RTOS I'm using (FreeRTOS) has functions 
which ensure exclusivity, which I have used for my malloc_lock and 
malloc_unlock routines, so I'm pretty happy that malloc should be 
threadsafe...

Thanks again for the help,

Daniel

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a better way of doing this however (a function attribute or

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> hmm, making the dummy malloc_lock malloc_unlock functions in newlib
