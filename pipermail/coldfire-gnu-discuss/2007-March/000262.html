I just read about that on the gcc website - I too am glad to see your 
ColdFire improvements being merged back to the mainline.  The fact that 
you guys are willing and able to contribute ColdFire improvements to gcc 
is the biggest reason for my choosing Code Sourcery in the first place 
(&quot;willing&quot; and &quot;able&quot; counting roughly equally).  Well done!

 From what I have read on the gcc website, gcc 4.2 has a number of small 
improvements, but gcc 4.3 is a more substantial improvement.  Is that right?

We may be looking at ARM development in the near future - do you also 
work directly on improvements on the ARM target of gcc?

mvh.,

David
