Is the strstr() bug (MAX_INT) in newlib fixed in the Q3 release ?

Message-ID: <EC5EE493B6046F45A2DDEC4A828DE52E033D3F99@EXCHSRVR.syntech.org>

I have been doing research into the gcc EMAC support on the Coldfire
(Specifically, the v2 mcf5235). The -memac option is spelled out in the
help, and support exists in the source code for the CPU features tree
(gcc/config/m68k*). However, I have come to the conclusion that it is
not yet implemented in the compiler. Am I correct?

The compiler has no support for emac. The -memac option you refer to is an 
option to the assembler.  The references to EMAC you may be seeing in the 
compiler's source concerns the speed of the regular multiply instruction.

Subject: problems when install coldfire m68k-elf.bin
Message-ID: <38B2E349C3AA4B4CAEEBEBBFA35F541C5DE880@red.qustream.net>

Dear

 

 When I install the toolchain freescale-coldfire-4.1-14-m68k-elf.bin  on
SUSE linux gcc version 4.1.2 20070115 , there would be errors.

And if I install the toolchain freescale-coldfire-4.3-54-m68k-elf.bin ,
the system information would like this:

I download the bin files from the website. And I am sure that the bin
file are correct.  Could you help me on the problems? Thank you very
much!

 

Merry Christmas!
