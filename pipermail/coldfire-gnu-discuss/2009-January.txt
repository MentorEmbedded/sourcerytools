The graphical installer requires DISPLAY environment variable be set to 
appropriate value.  If you do not have X11 connection to your host, you 
should get through using '-i console'.

Let me know if that doesn't help.

Subject: GDB and unresolved breakpoints (RedBoot, compiled under Cygwin)
Message-ID: <4965F602.5030702@proekspert.ee>

Hi!

We are developing RedBoot (boot loader for eCos) for MCF5208 using the 
Windows personal edition of 4.3-79 ELF toolchain. eCos requires a Unix 
build environment, so we build it under Cygwin. The build works and the 
resulting RedBoot runs just fine.

The problem is debugging RedBoot in Eclipse. It seems like GDB fails to 
understand absolute source file locations provided in ".debug" section.

For example: eCos source tree contains 3 different files named 
"eth_drv.c" in different directories. When setting a breakpoint, Eclipse 
displays a small yellow exclamation mark and message "Unresolved 
breakpoint". When stepping, display suddenly jumps from the correct file 
to the first instance of "eth_drv.c" it finds in the directory tree. It 
is not the file that was compiled. After that, stepping kind of goes 
haywire.

I don't understand why this is happening. GDB should know exactly which 
source file was used. ELF object's debug section contains the correct 
absolute file location. I checked that using the dwarfdump tool.

The absolute path is in unix format (because it's built in cygwin) 
"/ecos-c/foo/bar.c". Could this be the culprit?

Compiler and linker get options "-ggdb" and "-O0". These are full 
compiler options:

-mcpu=5208 -fno-use-cxa-atexit -isystem 
/ecos-c/Tools/CodeSourcery/SourceryG++/lib/gcc/m68k-elf/4.3.2/include/ 
-isystem 
/ecos-c/Tools/CodeSourcery/SourceryG++/lib/gcc/m68k-elf/4.3.2/include-fixed/ 
-malign-int -Wall -Wpointer-arith -Winline -Wundef -Woverloaded-virtual 
-ggdb -O0 -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions

I have uploaded a file which contains dwarfdump output for the module in 
question:

http://www.hot.ee/tarmospam/dwarfdump_redboot_eth_drv.txt

I am used to working on targets without debugger support. It's OK when 
there is no hope. However, it is quite annoying to come so close to a 
proper debug environment and then stumble over something this small.

Okay, problem solved. I forgot to add CYGPATH to Windows environment 
variables. Kudos to Codesourcery guys for the hint.

By the way - it's not quite plug and play. When debugging for the first 
time, Eclipse complains:

[quote begins]
Can't find a source file at "c:\ecos-c\projects\...[snip]...\vectors.S"
Locate the file or edit the source lookup path to include its location.
[quote ends]

The "\ecos-c" should have vanished when cygpath converted path to 
windows format. In my case is still there and breaks the path.

Pressing the button "Locate File" and browsing to the source 
automatically adds a path mapping from "c:\ecos-c" to "c:\" which heals 
the defective path. I can proceed with actual debugging.

So there's no c:\ecos-c\ directory?  Does "$CYGPATH -w
/ecos-c/projects/.../vectors.S" print what you'd expect?

None of the path manipulation is in SG++; we delegate it all to Cygwin.

Hi,
I'm using eclipse and Sourcery G++ Lite Edition with a coldfire EVM. I
have used the FREERTOS code (Coldfire V2 RTOS and TCP/IP Demo).
I can build the project and download the program in flash memory using
freescale's "CF Flasher 3.1".
Problems arise when I try to debug the code.
To identify the problem, I have used the command prompt console and text
commands. The steps are:

Before you hit "c", could you make sure if pc is set correctly with "p pc"? 
  If you need to update it, you can say "set pc=0xNNNNNNNN".  If I remember 
correctly, "target remote ..." doesn't set pc for you.  You would have to 
do that manually.

Hope this helps,

Hi Roberto,

I use:

set $pc = _start
continue

@0x0000 there is the start address of the program and not the first
instruction on the ColdFire.

Please consider also the remarks in
http://www.codesourcery.com/archives/coldfire-gnu-discuss/msg00559.html
which addresses some issues when debugging from Flash. Maybe your
linker script links OK. The symbol _start must not point to 0x400
since the ColdFire expects memory access bit masks there. Otherwise
later the program will run into memory access exceptions.

Best regards
Nathan Braun

Thank you for your help,
now it works from dos prompt.
I can debug the code also from eclipse (but only if I write the "continue" command manually in the console, if I use the "continue" command directly from the "run commands" in "debug configurations" eclipse freezes and I must terminate it...)

I'd say you have a setup problem.
Address 0 contains the reset-SP and 0x4 the entry point.

Try setting the PC manually to the value of _start (obtained from the map file).

The error occurs because you are using windows drive letters (C: and 
D:). For example:

PROJ_DIR = "D:/Tools/HelloFirst"
LDSCRIPT = "C:/Program Files/CodeSourcery/Sourcery 
G++/m68k-elf/lib/m5475/m5485evb-ram.ld"

There were many others scattered around your Makefile.

Make is a unix tool. It treats the colon ':' as a special character. You 
are not allowed to use the colon anywhere else - not in file names nor 
command arguments.

Replace all drive letters with their Cygwin mount points. Usually "C:" 
corresponds to "/cygdrive/c", "D:" is "/cygdrive/d" etc. You can get a

Are you using a managed make project, or trying to write the Makefile
by hand?  Managed make is much easier.

The version of Make we ship with Sourcery G++ understands drive
letters, not Cygwin paths.

Hi!

I saw the exact same problem as OP when building eCos. The "make" 
included with cygwin chokes on windows paths (those seem to come from 
Sourcery G++ when it is interrogated for system includes). We use a 
(rather ugly) workaround to get unix-only paths.

That's news for me.

Pablo, you might want to ignore my previous advice. Try using "cs-make" 
instead of "make" for building your project.

[offtopic]

Does cs-make also understand Cygwin paths? When I try, an
   "include /ecos-c/.../rules.mak"
statement found in a makefile results in error
   "No such file or directory".

No, I don't think it does.  It's provided primarily for the use of our
IDE, which generates Windows paths on Windows (and Unix paths on Linux
hosts, obviously).

For eCos, I suspect you'll be better off using Cygwin make, and
appropriate uses of "cygpath -u" and "cygpath -w" as necessary to
convert Windows paths to/from Cygwin paths.

Ok. I wasn't expecting that either. Thank you for the replies.

I already do. Everything is Unix-style to satisfy cygwin's make (it 
takes some hacking to ensure that). Path conversion is done by your gcc 
and this works flawlessly (except when debugging inside Eclipse).

I was simply curious about potential alternatives.

eCos's makefiles are unmodifiable. They are generated inside an 
unpenetrable fortress of spaghetti scripts.

Subject: Compiled shared uClibc with another shared lib
Message-ID: <EC5EE493B6046F45A2DDEC4A828DE52E033D4021@EXCHSRVR.syntech.org>

I am attempting to generate a shared library using a custom compiled
uClibc.

I extracted the uClibc source from the CodeSourcery 4.2-153 archive, and
I was able to compile using a config file from the build script.

m68k-uclinux-gcc -nostdlib -mid-shared-library -mshared-library-id=3 -o
lib3.so \
	$(ROOTDIR)/uClibc/lib/Scrt1.o $(ROOTDIR)/uClibc/lib/crti.o \
	-Wl,--whole-archive ${OBJECTS} -Wl,--no-whole-archive \
	-Wl,-R,$(ROOTDIR)/uClibc/lib/libc.gdb \
	-lpthread -lgcc $(ROOTDIR)/uClibc/lib/crtn.o

The linker errors out with the following:

...uClibc/lib/Scrt1.o: In function `lib_main':
(.text+0x8): undefined reference to `__shared_flat_add_library'
Collect2: ld returned 1 exit status


The linker doesn't seem to know about the information from libc.gdb.

The previous way I've linked is with the builtin shared libc. That
method is successful.

Subject: Coldfire application/compiler problem
Message-ID: <49838E28.5080809@meadorresearch.com>

Hello,

I have a c++ application using Freescale 547x_548x 2007 BSP which
compiles runs using compiler version:
g++ version 4.1.1 (CodeSourcery Sourcery G++ 4.1-30).

However, I needed to upgrade to the latest Freescale 2008 BSP fix
corruptions which were caused by a flaw in the CPU cache handling of the
kernel -- the release notes claim this issue is fixed in the latest 2008
BSP.

My application (same exact code) now crashes with a strange problem when
compiled with the 2008 BSP compiler:
g++ version 4.2.3 (Sourcery G++ Lite 4.2-125)

I also tried upgrading to the latest CodeSourcery compiler:
gcc version 4.3.2 (Sourcery G++ Lite 4.3-43)  - but I get the same crash
behaviour as the Lite-4.2-125 version.

The problem I am getting is my application starts up and runs, but then
it crashes as soon as it calls "new" to allocate a specific class.   No
constructor code is executed before the crash.  I have tried the
following to determine where the crash could be happening, but it
appears as though the breakage is in the code executed just prior to
calling the constructor (sorry I don't know the compiler terminology here):

* Tried logging first line inside the constructor - no logs are
executed, but crashes after the call to "new"
* Tried eliminating the body code of the constructor, no help
* Tried calling "new"/"delete" with sizeof(MyClass) just prior to the
real alloc and the test alloc/delete completes fine, but crashes upon
calling the alloc of "MyClass".
* Tried moving the alloc MyClass call to various other places in the
code, it crashes upon the first call every time.

Does anyone have any ideas what this could be and how I might go about
figuring this out? 
Any help would be greatly appreciated,

Dave
