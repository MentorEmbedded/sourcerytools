Subject: Issues with ColdFire toolchain
Message-ID: <20060511100651.91302353BE7@atlas.denx.de>

Hello,

we try to use the GCC-4.1 based toolchain for ColdFire to  build  the
U-Boot boot loader, the Linux kernel and some applications.

We ran into some problems:

(1) It seems that this configuration lacks  -fPIC  support  which  is
    crucial  for  U-Boot  building. [I am aware that -fpic support is
    present, but this is unfortunately not sufficient, too small  GOT
    size available.]

    Are there plans to support -fPIC ?

(2) We can build applications, but they don't run. For example,  when
    building OpenVPN we get:

	# ./openvpn
	Allocation of length 1136352 from process 46 failed
	DMA per-cpu: empty
	Normal per-cpu:
	cpu 0 hot: low 2, high 6, batch 1
	cpu 0 cold: low 0, high 2, batch 1
	HighMem per-cpu: empty

	Free pages:        5728kB (0kB HighMem)
	Active:571 inactive:1147 dirty:0 writeback:0 unstable:0 free:1432 slab:541 mapped:0

	lowmem_reserve[]: 0 0 0
	HighMem free:0kB min:128kB low:160kB high:192kB active:0kB inactive:0kB present:0kB
	pages_scanned:0 all_unreclaimable? no
	lowmem_reserve[]: 0 0 0
	DMA: empty
	Normal: 4*4kB 4*8kB 5*16kB 1*32kB 1*64kB 1*128kB 1*256kB 2*512kB 2*1024kB 1*2048kB
	0*4096kB = 5728kB
	HighMem: empty
	Unable to allocate RAM for process text/data, errno 12
	pid 46: failed 4

    Using the old uCLinux GCC-2.95 toolchain  this  works  fine.  For
    this working image, "file" reports

	openvpn: BFLT executable - version 4 gotpic

    Your GC-4.1 toolchain gives:

	openvpn: BFLT executable - version 4 ram

    Is this a problem? Any other idea what might be wrong?

Best regards,

Wolfgang Denk

We don't have an immediate plan to support -fPIC.  We're discussing future 
features with FreeScale.

There are many possible causes.  I doubt the static link is the culprit.  It 
seems that the memory map of openvpn is suspect.

Is the entire filesystem built with the same toolchain?  I'm not sure,
but I think a number of ABI changes have been made.

As it turns out, the size of the image  seems  to  be  important.  By
disabling  features we created configuration that resulted in smaller
images, and these work fine. The critical size seems to be 1 MB -  if
the images are smaller, they work; if they are bigger, they cannot be
loaded.

Ah, that makes sense.  I'm not sure why you did not get a link error, as the 
linker script constrains the memory size to 1MB.  We'll investigate.

ah ha. I was wrong, the linker script allows 16MB images.  But also uses the top 
8 bits for the library-id.  That is inconsistent.

Message-ID: <44703812.4080705@objectxp.com>

Hello,

The following code doesn't work as expected when compiled with the codesourcery 
toolchain:

#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   system("/bin/busybox");
   exit(0);
}

command-line used for compiling:

$ m68k-uclinux-gcc -m5200 -Wl,-elf2flt test.c -o test

When executing this program on the target (M5271EVB), the following happens:

# ./test
?: applet not found

However, If I use the GCC-2.95.3-based Toolchain from uclinux.org, the program 
works as expected.

Is this a bug in the version of uclibc included in the codesourcery toolchain?

Regards,

Michel

I've tried your test case and it works ok for the m5208evb board that we have 
for testing.  This is running a linux-2.6.12-uc0 kernel.

Can you determine what is emitting the 'applet not found' message?

That's a message from busybox itself. E.g. if you invoke "busybox blabla" you 
will get "blabla: applet not found". According to the system() manpage, it will 
call "/bin/sh -c <command>", so it looks like the command passed to system() 
somehow gets lost/garbled.

The board we're using runs linux-2.6.17-rc4 and busybox 1.1.3.

ah, so IIUC, it appears the "/bin/busybox" string is being transformed into 
"/bin/busybox ?", so busybox is trying to find the '?' applet.

thanks for this information.  At the moment we're unable to reproduce the 
problem.  Have you tried a shell builtin, such as
	system ("echo hello");
?

"/bin/busybox -c ?" that is...

Here's what happens when calling  system("echo hello"):

# ./test
?<... '?' repeats about 8000 times...>?: applet not found

Actually, the shell shows '?', but the real value of these chars is 0xff (as 
seen when redirecting stderr and piping it through 'hd').

And here's the output of system("/sbin/ifconfig eth0"):

I?z?(?xp;;??????a??9?RNC??o%???g?!??"?q93S?R?QaGaG?JJ?$U|?t?U?^%u?}??la?5?F?4a???(V??w??E???????!???????;?????????gJnyp??j??>?w?Yd??%c?????o?%??W?2?v?B-????,WR???i"?r,??????pu?:l???p??'????W???u??>??Q?^??S?~?RqOuN2?9>???x?v?f%K_?????uOo?-s????P?I???n?r??(???f+I?1<)?{zB-YR?]??VyF??:

aha, I'm sorry, I forgot that you would be using the 4.1-3 public release.  I've 
been reminded that we fixed this bug, but have yet to make a new public release.

The bug is that gcc fails to maintain 4 byte stack alignment.  For m68k targets, 
this is fine, but the coldfire targets are much more picky.  uclibc contains an 
alloca call in the 'system' function that misaligns the stack.

We will be making a new public release shortly, it is undergoing final testing.

Greetings,

This is off the GNU topic, but I'm looking for information on using 
BDM/Jtag.

I downloaded the toolchain and it appears to work on a Linux box.  I have 
a BDM/parallel interface that came with an earlier 5272 coldfire project 
that I need to make work on the M5223X chips.

Can anyone point me to the program I need to download programs, or is that 
all incorporated into gdb?  Thanks.

GDB should be able to load the program into RAM.  Use the "load" command
to load the program on the target.  At present, GDB does not know how to
burn the program into flash.  That's something we're working on, and
will be a part of our toolchains at some point in the future.
