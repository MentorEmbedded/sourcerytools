<PRE>I'm trying to see exactly how the new CS3 startup code works, with a 
view to using it instead of my own hand-written startup code for 
ColdFire projects, but I'm having a great deal of difficulty finding the 
source for the library.  I am currently using the &quot;lite&quot; version 
freescale-coldfire-4.2.47-m68k-elf on windows (my subscription ran out 
about a month ago, and we haven't yet figured out if we want to renew 
it, and which computers we need to use it on).

As far as I can figure out, the newlib-stable/libgloss/m68k directory in 
the 4.2.47 source code tarball contains the source for the older startup 
code - files such as cf-crt1.c are labelled copyright 2006, and use the 
earlier style of startup.  The Makefile.in in this directory will 
generate the older linker files (m5213evb-ram-hosted.ld, etc) and not 
the newer versions (which have clock-speed specific versions for 
convenience).

This is important to me various reasons.  I like to know exactly what 
code is running on my boards, and I need to be able to modify the 
startup code (for using my own boards that do not correspond directly to 
the evaluation boards, for re-arranging memory maps to suit my needs, 
and for adding new features such as making extra sections that go at 
specific addresses).

I also note that you've made a little mistake in the rom version of the 
linker files - your .bss section is marked &quot;&gt;ram AT&gt;rom&quot; instead of just 
&quot;&gt;ram&quot; - there is no need for the .bss section to be mirrored in rom.

Thanks for any pointers,

David Brown
