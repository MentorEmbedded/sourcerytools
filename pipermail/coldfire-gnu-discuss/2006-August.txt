Subject: Problems with -mcpu=assembler  switch
Message-ID: <59789F6B85725F4CAD78243CDDBA4C662226B1@SERVA.grange.local>

Hi
 
I have noticed a slight problem with the m68k-elf-as assembler in your
current release of the ColdFire toolchain.
 
I'm building for an mcf5282 target so I have set -mcpu=5282 and just
get: 

"error: bad value (5282) for -mcpu= switch"

although 5282 is listed as a valid CPU target by -help and
--target-help.

The 528x switch seems ok.

Cheers,
 
Paul.

Hi Paul!

Thanks for your interested in our Sourcery G++ Coldfire toolchains.

1. Are you running the assembler directly or through GCC?
2. Which version of the toolchain are you using? (m68k-elf-gcc --version)

The compiler does not accept -mcpu=5282, it only accepts 528x.
The assembler accepts -mcpu=5282.

Ufnortuantely the output of "m68k-elf-gcc --target-help" is sometimes
confusing since it includes help information for the assembler.

The 5281, 5282, 5283 are the same as 528x. I will file an internal issue
so that the compiler and assembler have similar options.

Cheers,
Carlos.

Sorry, I'm off by one here, that list should be 5280, 5281, 5282.

Cheers,
Carlos.

Hi Carlos,

Thanks for the quick reply! OK, I'm new to the GNU toolchain so maybe I
should have tested with the assembler direct!

I'm calling the assembler through m68k-elf-gcc, but I'm looking at the
help output from m68k-elf-as.

Versions are m68k-elf-gcc 4.1-14 and m68k-elf-as 2.16.91

Cheers,
 
Paul.

To expand on what Carlos said: it probably should be considered a bug
that the options for the compiler and assembler are different.  Also,
we recommend that you always run GCC rather than the assembler directly
- on some platforms GCC knows a lot about how to invoke the assembler
and linker correctly.  So, you're doing everything right.

Calling the assembler through m68k-elf-gcc is the right thing to do, the
compiler driver knows how to pass the right options.

Ok.

Glad we could help!

Cheers,
Carlos.

Hello,

I have downloaded the source tar  
ball(freescale-coldfire-4.1-14-m68k-uclinux.src.tar.bz2) and found out  
lots of hardcoded path in freescale-coldfire-4.1-14-m68k-uclinux.sh. I  
wonder how to modify it so I can build it myself.

Thanks,

the build script intentionally controls the build environment and records 
exactly the commands we used to build the toolchain.  You should be able to 
modify it for your environment, but be aware that it can be tricky.
