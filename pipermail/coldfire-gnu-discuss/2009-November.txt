OK.  Please let me know if you stumble upon a problem in the sprite.

Subject: MCF52259 defines?
Message-ID: <4B017EF9.4000301@wireless-solutions.ltd.uk>

Although G++ has CS3 file for the MCF52259EVB, I can't for the life of 
me find anything that defines the pins/registers for the 52259 MCU or 
the family.

Am I missing something or have I got to write this lot manually or poach 
it from CodeWarrior?

John

Sourcery G++ Lite does not provide defines for memory mapped registers 
of ColdFire microprocessors and microcontrollers.  However this feature 
is in our plans for the Sourcery G++ Professional toolchains.

Subject: Solution: Compiling C code without producing a .eh_frame section.
 (GCC 4.4.1/CS 4.4-52 Lite)
Message-ID: <4B0BCA1E.2060809@alumnus.utwente.nl>

Hi All,

I've upgraded to the latest CodeSourcery Lite ELF for Coldfire (uses GCC 
4.4.1). The upgraded compiler produced exception frames (.eh_frame) 
section even for pure C compiles, which the old version didn't do.

To avoid these unnecessary sections, add -fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm as a 
compiler argument.

It took me a while to figure this out -- I hope this message will help 
others.

Regards,
Niels Moseley.
