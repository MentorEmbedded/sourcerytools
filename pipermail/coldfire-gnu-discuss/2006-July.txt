Subject: Sourcery G++ 4.1-14 for ColdFire now available
Message-ID: <44A886C4.3000304@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery has released Sourcery G++ 4.1-14 for ColdFire.

Notable improvements in this release, relative to 4.1-11:

* Toolchains for ColdFire GNU/Linux are now available, in addition to
updates for ColdFire uClinux and ColdFire ELF.

* GDB now supports hardware watchpoints and breakpoints.

* The ColdFire BDM stub, designed for use with P&E Micro's debugging
hardware, now provides much improved semi-hosting support.  You can use
this functionality to access files on the host system from target
programs in the ColdFire ELF toolchains.  The stub is also considerably
faster.

* The uClinux toolchains now support position-independent code, shared
libraries, and prioritized constructors and destructors.  The linker can
now reduce the size of flat objects by merging constant data and by
optimizing unwind information.

Sourcery G++ Lite toolchains (containing the command-line tools) are
available from:

  http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/coldfire/download.html

Sourcery G++ Personal Edition toolchains (including an Eclipse-based
IDE) and Professional Edition toolchains (including the IDE and
unlimited support) are available from the CodeSourcery's online store:

Subject: Difference in uClinux and ELF version for the Coldfire
Message-ID: <44AD9171.1040402@adaptivedesignconcepts.com>

Hi all -

Can anyone tell me the difference between the uClinux and ELF versions 
of gcc/windows for the coldfire?  I tried using the uClinux version and 
the m68k-uclinux-ld failed when it tried to link.  I know the 
makefile/linker script/etc works, cuz I use them on a FD4 box.

The files that I am compiling are not related to uClinux, but are stand 
alone applications.

I'm going to try the ELF version tonight.

Thanks
Mark

The uclinux linker produces FLT format binaries, not ELF ones.  There are other 
minor differences between calling conventions on the two systems.

You should probably be using m68k-elf-ld then.

If this doesn't answer your question, we're going to need to know
*) how you are invoking the linker
*) what errors you are getting

Subject: USB P&E BDM and GnuToolChain...
Message-ID: <8beafc690607100630m129ff349lf264887b85a8455e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I just bought the board m52235evb and it was very nice to realize Gnu
ToolChains support it.
The only problem is that when I begin to stablish connection with it, I
receive the next error message:

(gdb) target remote | m68k-elf-cfpe-stub -t m52235evb
A program is being debugged already.  Kill it? (y or n) y
putpkt: write failed: Broken pipe.
Remote debugging using | m68k-elf-cfpe-stub -t m52235evb
m68k-elf-cfpe-stub:error:Could not load P&E DLL

I read something in the pdf manual of the tools, and they just said to go to
P&E website and download
the USB drivers, which unfortunatelly are built just for Windows.

Is there any way to load my elf applications on the board, by using the P&E
bdm cable (USB) on Linux??

Thanks in advance...

Ricardo.

We are going through the process of getting permission from P&E to distribute 
this software.  P&E have agreed in principal, but we don't have that in writing 
yet.  I'm not sure why P&E's web site has no linux hosted driver or library, btw.

Subject: Patch for Freescale's Linux kernel
Message-ID: <44B2A3C6.4020104@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery's recent GNU/Linux release was tested with the combination
of Freescale's 2.6.10-based Linux kernel (from
http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=CWB-MCF547X-548X-2-6-KL&srch=1)
and the attached patch, provided by Matt Waddel of Freescale.  The patch
fixes a number of issues that were found while validating the toolchain,
so we recommend that users apply this patch.

Mark,

Any word on being able to use the BDM loader with the flash series 
mcf52235?  Thanks.

We do now have software that can program the flash on some ColdFire
boards.  That has not yet been released, but we plan to make that
capability available to our subscription customers in the relatively
near future.

Nathan, do you know if the MCF52235 board is one of the ones that we've
tested?  If not, do you know whether the flash on that board is similar
to the boards we have validated?

Thanks,

We've not checked any flash chips beyond those on the m5208evb and m5485evb boards.
