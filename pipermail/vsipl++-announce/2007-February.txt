Subject: Sourcery VSIPL++ 1.3 Available
Message-ID: <45D22DDC.4050804@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery is pleased to announce the availability of Sourcery
VSIPL++ 1.3.  This new version of Sourcery VSIPL++, a toolkit for
developing high-performance signal- and image-processing applications
has a number of improvements and new features.  Highlights include
support for C-VSIPL libraries as back-ends for computation, including
matrix-vector products, linear algebra solvers, and signal processing
objects, and performance optimizations when using the Mercury SAL and
PAS libraries.

This version of Sourcery VSIPL++ contains the new VSIPL++ reference
implementation.  It is a full implementation of the serial and
parallel API, using C-VSIPL and MPI as back-end libraries for
computation and communication respectively.  Please note that not all
technology and files in Sourcery VSIPL++ are part of the reference
implementation.  See the LICENSE file in source package for more
details.

Sourcery VSIPL++ is a full implementation of the VSIPL++ API, an open
standard for platform-independent signal- and image-processing
developed by the DOD High Performance Embedded Computing Software
Initiative (HPEC-SI) and the VSIPL Forum. Sourcery VSIPL++ provides
many high-level routines used in SIP computing, such as FFTs, FIR
filters, SVD and QR decomposition, and linear algebra.
