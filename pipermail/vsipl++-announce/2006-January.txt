Message-ID: <43D52104.9080908@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery is pleased to announce the availability of Sourcery
VSIPL++ 1.0, a toolkit for developing high-performance signal- and
image-processing applications.

    http://www.codesourcery.com/vsiplplusplus

Sourcery VSIPL++ is a full implementation of the VSIPL++ API, an open
standard for platform-independent signal- and image-processing
developed by the DOD High Performance Embedded Computing Software
Initiative (HPEC-SI) and the VSIPL Forum.  Sourcery VSIPL++ provides
many high-level routines used in SIP computing, such as FFTs, FIR
filters, SVD and QR decomposition, and linear algebra.

Sourcery VSIPL++ applications run on parallel systems with only
minimal changes to the serial version.  You specify how data should be
distributed across processors and Sourcery VSIPL++ will automatically
distribute the data and manage the necessary communications.

Sourcery VSIPL++ has been designed from the ground up for maximum
performance, whether running in serial or in parallel.  Sourcery
VSIPL++ uses sophisticated C++ techniques and platform-specific
low-level libraries to provide the blazing speed of hand-tuned
assembly with all the convenience of a portable, open-standard,
high-level API.  Sourcery VSIPL++ achieve maximum performance on
todays' systems without sacrificing portability and scalability to
tomorrows' new technology.

VSIPL++ documentation, request a free 30-day evaluation, and even
download binary and source versions of VSIPL++ to start taking
advantage of VSIPL++ immediately.
