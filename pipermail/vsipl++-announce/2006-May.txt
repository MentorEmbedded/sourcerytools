Subject: Sourcery VSIPL++ 1.1 Available
Message-ID: <446B121F.9070204@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery is pleased to announce the availability of Sourcery VSIPL++
1.1.  This new version of Sourcery VSIPL++, a toolkit for developing
high-performance signal- and image-processing applications, adds support
for Mercury's MCOE operating system, Sun's Solaris operating system, and
significantly improves performance on other systems through the use of
SIMD instructions and an updated FFT implementation.

Sourcery VSIPL++ is a full implementation of the VSIPL++ API, an open
standard for platform-independent signal- and image-processing
developed by the DOD High Performance Embedded Computing Software
Initiative (HPEC-SI) and the VSIPL Forum. Sourcery VSIPL++ provides
many high-level routines used in SIP computing, such as FFTs, FIR
filters, SVD and QR decomposition, and linear algebra.
