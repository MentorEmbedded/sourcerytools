Subject: Sourcery VSIPL++ 1.2 Available
Message-ID: <450E172B.20803@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery is pleased to announce the availability of Sourcery VSIPL++
1.2.  This new version of Sourcery VSIPL++, a toolkit for developing
high-performance signal- and image-processing applications has a number 
of improvements and new features.  Highlights include greater 
portability with support for the Windows platform and the Intel C++ 
compiler, improved performance with SIMD loop fusion to make greater use 
of the PowerPC AltiVec and Intel SSE instruction sets, improved 
parallelism with support for Mercury's Parallel Acceleration System 
(PAS) library, and increased productivity with an integrated profiling 
capability to gather application performance data.

Sourcery VSIPL++ is a full implementation of the VSIPL++ API, an open
standard for platform-independent signal- and image-processing
developed by the DOD High Performance Embedded Computing Software
Initiative (HPEC-SI) and the VSIPL Forum. Sourcery VSIPL++ provides
many high-level routines used in SIP computing, such as FFTs, FIR
filters, SVD and QR decomposition, and linear algebra.
