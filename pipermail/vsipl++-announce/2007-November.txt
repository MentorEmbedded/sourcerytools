Subject: Live Webcast: Cell Broadband Engine by IBM and CodeSourcery
Message-ID: <4734F341.2090401@codesourcery.com>

Attached is an announcement about a joint presentation by IBM and
CodeSourcery regarding the Cell Broadband Engine and some of the signal-
and image-processing library development that CodeSourcery is doing for
the Cell/B.E.  This presentation will take place on November 15th, at
2PM EST/11AM PST.

Max Aguilar, an IBM Master Inventor, will be explaining some of the key
aspects of the Cell/B.E. hardware platform.  I will talk about Sourcery
VSIPL++ for the Cell/B.E., as well as two lower-level programming
interfaces that will also be useful to developers of high-performance
signal and image-processing programs.
