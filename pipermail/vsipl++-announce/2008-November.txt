Message-ID: <49121FED.70901@codesourcery.com>

CodeSourcery is pleased to announce the availability of Sourcery VSIPL
2.0, Sourcery VSIPL++ 2.0, and Sourcery VSIPL++ 2.0 Lite.  Sourcery
VSIPL is an entirely new library that implements the VSIPL API and is
interoperable with Sourcery VSIPL++.  Sourcery VSIPL++ is a new
version that offers a number of improvements and new features.

Sourcery VSIPL++ and Sourcery VSIPL are a full implementations of the
VSIPL++ and VSIL APIs, respectively, open standards for
platform-independent signal and image-processing developed by the DOD
High Performance Embedded Computing Software Initiative (HPEC-SI) and
the VSIPL Forum. Both provide many high-level routines used in SIP
computing, such as FFTs, FIR filters, SVD and QR decomposition, and
linear algebra. Sourcery VSIPL++ offers the added benefits of greater
productivity and performance through C++'s high-level syntax, and
support for multiple processor systems.
