Subject: QMTest 2.4.1 released
Message-ID: <49491470.6080804@codesourcery.com>

I'm pleased to announce the QMTest 2.4.1 release, available
for download from http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest/2.4.1/download.html.

This release contains a number of minor changes and adjustments, mainly 
aimed at making QMTest usable with Python 2.6, as well as to improve 
packaging (rpm in particular).

Thanks,
