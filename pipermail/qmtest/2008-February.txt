Subject: is rsh_target available for windows?
Message-ID: <4A27D05E36DE7E47B96BCF7DD8F3FD71D28ECA2C@NASANEXMB04.na.qualcomm.com>

Hi,

In the documentation, process_target is not available for windows, and rsh_target is derived from process_target.

Would anyone please tell me if rsh_target is available for windows?

Thanks,
Robin

Subject: Issues trying to uplift qmtest for LSB libstdc++ test
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0802201254570.8546@norris.e-artisan.org>


Hi,

I'm working for the Linux Foundation, and we're looking at uplifting the 
qmtest we distribute to 2.4, as 2.2 is getting rather old.  I can 
build/package qmtest fine, but am running into issues now building/running 
the libstdc++ tests.

I'm not really that well versed in using qmtest, so it's quite possible 
I'm overlooking something really obvious.

First issue seems to be the change in _RunTargetExecutable -

build/lib.linux-i686-2.4/qm/test/classes/dejagnu_test.py:
def _RunTargetExecutable(self, context, result, file)

in 2.2 sources:
build/lib.linux-i686-2.4/qm/test/classes/dejagnu_test.py: def 
_RunTargetExecutable(self, context, result, file, dir = None):
 
So I get complaints about too many arguments, as the libstdc++ test has:

qm-classes/qmtest_gcc/v3_test.py: def _RunTargetExecutable(self, context, 
result, file, dir = None):

Tried patching that out to use the 2.4 syntax and then hit:

qm.test.context.ContextException: The context variable 
"CompilerTable.target" was not defined.

Defined 'CompilerTable.target=' in build_binary_testsuite and 
build_v3_dist, and now hit:

exceptions.AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'Run'

Also tried a different approach, keeping the 5 argument 
_RunTargetExecutable, renaming it to _RunLSBTargetExecutable, which 
eventually led me to the same 'str' object has no attribute 'Run'.

Any pointers?
Thanks,

The 'CompilerTable.target' entry in the context is generated by a 
resource. Its value is an object, which does provide a 'Run' method.

The QMTest internal API has changed between versions 2.2 and 2.4, and 
extensions need to reflect that.

Thanks. 

I figured it was the API change that was biting me here, just a  little 
lost as to where to start to update the test code for the new ABI 
(I wasn't involved in writing the test code).

I'll dig in to the CompilerTable.target entry some more.

The 2.4 release contains a 'compilation_test_database' extension module 
that may show you how to add a CompilerTable resource.
