Yes.  The Windows installer generated by Python's distutils does use a 
different directory layout.  It's not possible to replicate that with

   ./configure --prefix=...

You'd have to look at how distutils work to duplicate that.

You should be able to use the --prefix= approach on Windows, though; 
you'll just end up with a slightly different layout.

&gt;<i> 2. If I go with option 2, where is the Windows-installer binary created?
</I>&gt;<i> I ran the script but then didn't know what to do next.
</I>
It is in the 'dist/' subdirectory.  Look for the .exe file.

&gt;<i> 3. I wanted to try reinstalling the stable release under Windows, so I
</I>&gt;<i> deleted what I thought were all the relevant folders under the
</I>&gt;<i> C:\Python23 directory, then re-ran the installation file.  It created
</I>&gt;<i> the qm tree under site-packages, but didn't put anything in the Scripts
</I>&gt;<i> directory this time..?  
</I>
It's possible that you confused it by manually removing the files rather 
than by going through the Control Panel to Add/Remove Programs.

There should be a Scripts\qmtest.py file when the new version is 
installed, but if not that might represent some kind of packaging 
problem.  I'll look into that.

&gt;<i> 4. As an alternative to building under Windows, I have my Linux
</I>&gt;<i> directories mounted under Windows, so I wonder if I could somehow point
</I>&gt;<i> the Windows qmtest.py script to use the Linux installation under
</I>&gt;<i> /home/afunk/qm/lib/python2.3/site-packages?
</I>
You might be able to do that, indeed.  I'm not sure how well that might 
work.  You could also try just using the &quot;qmtest&quot; script that is 
installed on the GNU/Linux side.  There may be directory assumptions 
built into the code that are different for Windows vs. UNIX-like 
systems, but if there are, we might want to eliminate them.

Thanks,
