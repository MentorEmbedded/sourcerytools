<PRE>Hi All,

I'm new to QMTest and, although it's looking like a tool with great 
possibilities, I'm having some problems.  I'm trying to decide if it's 
worth the time to get up to speed with QMTest - my need is urgent and I 
need a robust framework for production test automation soon.

In running 2.0.3 from the website, I came across a small bug that shows 
up during a simple test on a remote target.  The bug is in 
qm/test/classes/rsh_target.py.  I was able to hack it and get the test 
to work.

Today, I built a version of QMTest from the CVS repository and it blew 
up a bit more violently for the same test:

 File &quot;/opt/nextest/lib/qm/qm/test/qmtest.py&quot;, line 78, in ?
    exit_code = command.Execute()
  File &quot;/lib/qm/qm/test/cmdline.py&quot;, line 569, in Execute
  File &quot;/lib/qm/qm/test/cmdline.py&quot;, line 1099, in __ExecuteRemote
  File &quot;/opt/nextest/lib/python2.3/copy_reg.py&quot;, line 50, in _reconstructor
    obj = base.__new__(cls, state)
TypeError: ('dict.__new__(X): X is not a type object (classobj)', 
&lt;function _reconstructor at 0x81827d4&gt;, (&lt;class qm.test.context.Context 
at 0x833477c&gt;, &lt;type 'dict'&gt;, {}))

I understand that anything taken directly out of head-of-tree in CVS is 
not going to be a stable release, but I wanted to check it out.  I'm 
happy to stick with 2.0.3 if it's reliable.  (If any further info is 
needed to reproduce the error, let me know.)

Anyway, exploring the mail list archive, I see that several patches have 
been released (for 2.0.3?), and an alpha 2.1 announcement was made some 
time ago.  My questions:

Should I go with 2.0.3 for production use and apply the patches? 
Are there any glaring deficiencies in 2.0.3? 

On a related note, should I send documentation errors and bugs to this list?

Thanks for your time.
