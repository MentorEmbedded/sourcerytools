Hi all,

	Thanks for making this tool and making it available to pubic. I am looking 
to automate some testing we do and would like to use QMTest. But there are 
some additional features we would like.

1. Capability to multiple programs per test, each specifying the host to 
run on.
2. Capability to store the results into a database with timestamps on when 
they were run

Thanks,
Abhijeet

After sending out this email, i realized that the requirement 2 can be 
fulfilled with the XML out and then storing the XML into a database. I 
didn't know that xml output is available till I saw the xml_result_stream 
files in the source code.

Multiple programs can be started in parallel by creating them as multiple 
test cases in one suite and then executing the suite while setting the 
concurrency number to the number of programs to spawn. This should spawn 
all the programs parallely. Please let me know if this is a good assumption.

One other thing I would like to get is to be able to specify a regular 
expression to match with the stdout, instead of an exact match. So I want 
to find a PASS anywhere in the stdout, or not find "Error" anywhere in the 
output etc.

Thanks,
Abhijeet

Is your test really dependent on the processes running in parallel (say,
because you want to test concurrency), or do you just want to cover
multiple scenarios (hosts) in one shot ?

If it's the second, I believe you shouldn't lump them into a single test
but instead have one test instance per host and just tell qmtest to
run these tests in parallel for efficiency.

there's an sql result stream as well as an one using xml. That may provide
all you want.

Just thought I'd mention that the session start time is included in the 
leading annotations in the default XML result stream.  End-time is 
there, too, I think -- or I may have added that myself.  Too lazy to 
look right now.  :)

Anyway, this time data is per-session, not per-test.  If you need 
per-test timestamps, it would be a simple matter to add such an 
annotation to an existing (or new) test class.

I am thinking of tests where I need to spawn two processes (a client and a 
server, for example) on two different machines. So I need a way to spawn 
both and not have to wait for one to finish and then start the other.

Thanks,
Abhijeet

sounds sensible. Are you testing both ? or is the server just a requirement
for you to be able to test the client ? In that case you may want
to start the server in a resource's 'SetUp' method (and shut it down
in the 'CleanUp' method), and let the test be dependent on that resource.
That would be particularly useful if you wanted to run multiple client
tests that could all use the same server, which would be more efficient.

I use resources or special prerequisite tests to get the server 
configured and running.  Then, the client tests start running.  If the 
client tests can be run sequentially, things are simple.  Just create a 
test suite with all tests dependent on the resource or prereq that 
handles server startup.  QMTest will schedule the tests and ensure 
proper running order.  (Randomization is an option, too.)

If you want to run many tests concurrently against the server, there are 
many alternatives.  You can  run distributed instances of QMTest using 
the "target" metaphor (something I have not tried yet).  You can write 
run tests in parallel with QMTest's concurrency model.  Or you can "go 
it alone" and write a new test class that spawns subprocesses and 
connects to remote machines to control the clients.  This is how I 
currently deal with multiple machines and clients.

Each method has advantages and disadvantages.

Hi Abhijeet,

I also wanted to do this same thing.  I created a subclass of
ShellScriptTest and overrode qm.test.classes.ExecTestBase.RunProgram.
I'm not sure if this is the nicest way to do it but it seemed the most
expedient.  Another way to do it might be to specify the expected stdout
as a regexp and override the __CompareText method...

Thanks for pointing out the location. I have made this change and it seems 
to be working.

In a previous email, Stefan had mentioned that there is a sql result 
stream, which I was able to find. I could also find the 
create-results-database script which is a part of the tarball, but not the 
rpm. So the SQL stream of results seems to be working. So, thanks for 
pointing it out.

The next thing I would like to have :), is to be able to store the test 
database into Postgres. I could not find a class that does this. Has anyone 
done this before?

Thanks,
Abhijeet

No, I don't think so.  We have thought about it (and the name "test 
database" connotes the fact that we expected that people might want to 
put the database into a relational database engine), but I don't think 
anyone has implemented that yet.

Subject: Failed prerequisite is not failing a test
Message-ID: <6.0.0.22.2.20040903153310.043a6788@qcmail1.qualcomm.com>

Hi all,

I created a test using the GUI which has a prerequisite test that I know 
fails (it runs a perl script that does not exist). In the condition, I 
specify that the test should PASS. So, the real test program should not 
run, right? But in reality the program runs and the result of the test is 
PASS. Which means that either the prerequisite was not run of that its 
output was ignored.

Is this a problem in qmtest or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks,
Abhijeet

Here are the contents of the test qmt file.

Hi,

	Most of my test cases will be run on remote embedded targets and could be 
run from multiple hosts. What is the best way to prevent a target from 
running two tests from two different hosts that conflict with each other. 
For instance, the tests install a Linux kernel module and use it for 
something and they want exclusive access to it.

	I was thinking of creating a new kind of resource which would create a 
file with a particular file name in the Setup and if the file exists, then 
return UNTESTED. Is there a better way?

Are you talking about running multiple copies of QMTest simultaneously 
on different hosts, but sharing the target boards between those copies?  
If you want to avoid conflicts in that setup, something like what you 
are suggesting should work.

So here's what I think might work, please let me know if I overlooked 
something.

I am thinking of adding a new outcome called BUSY, a new resource called 
ExclusiveAccessResource in a new file called exclusive.py. In the SetUp 
function, the resource will check for existence of a file 
"/tmp/qmtest_exclusive" or some file like that and if it exists, set the 
result outcome to BUSY, else it will create that file in Setup and then 
remove it in Cleanup.

I am planning on changing the CheckForResponse code in execution_engine.py 
to check for the result, and if the result said BUSY, then put the test 
back on the stack using the result id as the test id.

Thanks,
Abhijeet

I think it would be much better to handle this is in the Target 
machinery, rather than changing the outcomes.  In particular, provide a 
mechanism for the Target to refuse to accept a new test.  In fact, you 
may already be able to reuse the existing mechanisms.  If the Target 
sees that the board has already been devoted to another test run, it 
would simply indicate that it cannot accept the test.

This is a common confusion: if you do not explicitly list the 
prerequisite among the tests you want to run, then it will not be run.  
We see prerequisites as purely an optimization: they provide a way of 
skipping some tests if earlier tests do not work the way you think.  
It's possible that this was a bad design decision; it is certainly true 
that you are not the first person to have been confused.  However, it is 
how QMTest presently works.

Certainly, having the execution engine clean up resources more 
aggressively would be fine.  In fact, they could be cleaned up after 
every use -- although that would be suboptimal.  But, the situation 
you're describing is a little more complex, in that the cleanup is 
mandatory.  In other words, the later tests require a "blank slate".

We certainly can't model this now, and it certainly seems like a 
reasonable thing to want.  So, the question is what the design space 
looks like.  I'm almost tempted to say that we ought to make the 
execution engine an extension class, and then let you override it...

Me neither.  It may be tricky to come up with an interface that is as 
tidy as that provided for Tests and Resources, although it does seem 
doable.  For example, the fact that a resource cannot be set up until 
another resource has been cleaned up is clearly something that _RunTests 
could manage.

The other option is to try to find some way to describe these 
dependencies in a generic way that the current execution engine could be 
taught to handle.  In the abstract, that might be even better, but we 
need to figure out what the right formalism is for these dependencies.  
In other words, we need to determine set of things on which a 
test/resource can depend.  At the moment, it can depend on a resource 
being set up, or on another test.  Perhaps all that we need to do is to 
allow tests/resources to depend on a resource being cleaned up.  That 
would also inolve adding a method to Target so that the execution engine 
could demand that a Resource be cleaned up, but that is relatively 
easy.  Thoughts?

Hi,

	When running tests on remote targets, it would be nice to be able to
say make and then qmtest run without having to go through copying
program files/libraries over to the target. Is there a good way to do
this with the current implementation? 

Thanks,
Abhijeet

I would probably use "make" itself to do this; have a "make test" target 
that does "make", copies the files, and then runs QMTest.

It sounds like something that is outside the scope of QMTest itself.
