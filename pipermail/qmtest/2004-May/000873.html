The installation procedure we are talking about applies to a source distribution,
and so you run it from the toplevel (source) directory, i.e. 'qm'.
If you already have files in /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/qm it's
because you either installed a binary distribution or you have a previous
release there.

As to the installation location, that is usually determined by the python
interpreter (a python 2.3 installation in /usr/local would typically install
new packages into /usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages...).
You can override these defaults using the '--prefix' option. See
'python setup.py --help' for everything you can choose at build/installation
time (again, this has to be run in the toplevel source directory, where you
should find a 'setup.py' file).

&gt;&gt;<i> However, the toplevel 'README' file still suggests to use 'configure; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make install;'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That appears to be a slim wrapper around the former, so I'm not sure why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is still suggested, or even necessary. Mark ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would imply that you have a file called &quot;configure&quot; and another one 
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;Makefile&quot; at the top of the tree, but I have no such files in 
</I>&gt;<i> the new version, I've tried to look in different directories, but had no 
</I>&gt;<i> luck. Where did you find it?
</I>
A source distribution should contain everything you need, i.e. 'configure',
'GNUMakefile.in', 'setup.py', etc.
I suspect you are not looking at the right place.

If we are talking about a binary distribution, all files are already
in their destination directory, and thus there isn't any choice any more
as to how to call the python interpreter. Generally binary distributions
are specific to the python versions they had been compiled for.
