Amusingly, the signal module defines a function called
&quot;PyOS_AfterFork&quot;, which appears to be responsible for resetting
various thread stuffs after a fork.  It just doesn't touch signals at
all (which makes it location all the curiouser).  I don't really
understand the Python source; PyOS_AfterFork is also defined in
Parser/intrcheck.c, somehow, with a somewhat different API.

In any case, this function should probably be doing signal mask stuff.

This still wouldn't fix the problem entirely, because popen(),
system() etc. don't trigger a call to PyOS_AfterFork (quoth
Doc/api/utilities.tex, &quot;If a new executable is loaded into the new
process, this function does not need to be called&quot;), so pthread_atfork
would perhaps be a better course.

Except, as you say, none of this would help us, not being able to
require users to use a fixed version of Python :-).

are heavy, and very few persons can carry a piano all by themselves.&quot;
