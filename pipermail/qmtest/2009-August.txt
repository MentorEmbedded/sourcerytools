Subject: QMTest remote target test
Message-ID: <ba8dd2f90908241707kde26f6ue7f0fa2c8adba115@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a beginner with QMTest and trying to run a test on remote target
but get the following error:

$ qmtest run time_test
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "../qmtest", line 132, in ?
    exit_code = main()
  File "../qmtest", line 110, in main
    exit_code = command.Execute()
  File "C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages\qm\test\cmdline.py", line 796, in Execute
    return method()
  File "C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages\qm\test\cmdline.py", line 1700,
in __ExecuteRun
    if engine.Run():
  File "C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages\qm\test\execution_engine.py",
line 269, in Run
    target.Start(self.__response_queue, self)
  File "C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages\qm\test\classes\process_target.py",
line 148, in Start
    child_pid = e.Spawn(arg_list)
  File "C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages\qm\executable.py", line 183, in Spawn
    startupinfo)[0]
TypeError: The object is not a PySTARTUPINFO object

Test file is just one C++ file. This is how I created the target:

$ ../qmtest create-target -a host=192.168.xx.xxx -a
remote_shell=/usr/bin/ssh  -a
database_path=$MY_HOME_DIR/dist_testing/qmtest-2.4.1/scripts/tdb1 a
rsh_target.RSHTarget

Test runs fine on the local machine. I believe it has something to do
with my setup but I am not sure what is causing it. SSH pipe works
fine as I have set up the connection with automatic login. Is there a
test demo file which would give me some clue?  Just for the sake of
experimenting I tried the same with explicitly providing the context
file in the argument list as well but the error didn't change. Thanks
much for your help in advance!

Thanks,
Alok
