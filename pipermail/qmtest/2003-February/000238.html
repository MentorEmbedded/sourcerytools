<PRE>This is very cool, thank you.

Links does interesting things, once I can figure out how to invoke menu
items.  Not having used links before, it's a bit confusing, but
workeable.

Konqueror 2.2.1 also works but the menus are a little bit off - I have
to be careful to move the mouse pointer down near the right side of the
File popdown menu, otherwise the popdown menu disappears as if I've
moved the mouse pointer out of that menu's rectangle.

Anyway, now I seem to be up and running.  I edited my http.conf to add
the ~/tdb Directory, restarted httpd and then invoked:

qmtest gui --no-browser -A 10.42.69.69 &amp;

Then, I went to my windows machine and pointed my browser to that
address and voila!  I saw what I expected and the menu bar does things
and I can run all those tests.  Very nice indeed.

Thanks for the pointer - I'll probably be back. Right now, I'm going
back to the tutorial...

John

Do you have any other browser lying around?  Try starting qmtest like
this:

        qmtest gui --no-browser

It will spit out a URL to point your (other) favorite browser at.  For
example, the text mode browser &quot;links&quot; seems to do ok with the
javascript.  KDE and GNOME also have their own browsers which are
worth a shot.
