I find the GUI quite convenient to introspect a test database interactively,
and so I'm very interested into improving the existing one (in particular,
since it is much more portable than any GUI toolkit - based will ever be).

</I>
Right. I'm not quite sure how important / popular this use case of modifying
a test database via the GUI really is.

&gt;<i> Did you look at boost results format?  See:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Thanks for the pointer. I have casually looked at the boost regression report,
and I definitely intend to have a close look to see what I could add to our
own reporting facility to support this.

&gt;<i> Essentially, there are several test results which are merged in a big table. 
</I>&gt;<i> Each failure can have &quot;notes&quot; -- that's my proposed failure annotations. As 
</I>&gt;<i> I've mentioned somewhere in the tracker, the key point is that there's one 
</I>&gt;<i> expectation file for all toolsets.
</I>
Oh, I missed that. Since in QMTest expectations are simply results of prior
test executions, my initial design proposal is to provide the means to
annotate result files. (Nothing is stopping you from using the same result
file as expectation in multiple toolsets.)

Does this make sense ?
