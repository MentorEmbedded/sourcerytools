I realize this point. OTOH, HTML approach incurs some sloweness and autoload 
tricks. Maybe some smart JavaScript can sure this, but I don't now much of 
JavaScript to comment.

&gt;<i> &gt; Essentially, there are several test results which are merged in a big
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; table. Each failure can have &quot;notes&quot; -- that's my proposed failure

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, I missed that. Since in QMTest expectations are simply results of prior

</I>&gt;<i> file as expectation in multiple toolsets.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this make sense ?
</I>
You mean &quot;this test results are for configuration 1&quot;? That would make sense. 
However
- last time I checked, expectations loading was hardcoded logic to test either 
for xml file or for pickled data. Maybe this changed, but if not, this is not 
particularly flexible. What if I have my own way to describe expectations.
- If xml/pickle format is OK for now, there should be some way to edit it with 
a GUI. Loading results for each configuration, editing them and saving would 
be very inconvenient. Say I want to mark a test as failing for gcc-2.95, 2.96 
and 2.95-stlport.

This suggests we probably need a format for expectation file that can contain 
several sets of results. So, QMTest will load the file and ask for results 
for a specific tested configuration.
