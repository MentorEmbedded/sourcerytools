Well, I think I can do it with a GUI already :-/ Not sure though.

I'm just arguing with the statement that one can just use results of a prior 
test run as expected result, without any manual editing. Imagine that I have 
just one configuration and an expected results file -- that contains manually 
changed expectation. If I add new test, rerun tests, and replace the 
expectations file, I loose the manually set expectations already stored 
there.

&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Each test result is for specific compiler version. I really don't want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to explicitly edit test results for each version of some broken compiler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -- I want to specify that some compiler is broken.
</I>&gt;<i>

test/compiler_vendor combination. Say, &quot;this tests fails on all versions of 
yfc&quot;, as opposed to explicitly listing 15 versions of &quot;yfc&quot; where the test 
fails.

&gt;<i> (Why running the test suite on that compiler if 
</I>&gt;<i> 'broken' is not per-test ?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The above means that editing expectation is not so uncommon expectation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also manually edit them for my project at work, for the same reason.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And I suppose some people would be more comfortable editing text file, as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opposed to using GUI, so allowing to specify expectations in a text file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there is a xml-based result format that QMTest understands.
</I>
Yea, but if people decide that editing 15 files for 15 versions of &quot;yfc&quot; is 
not too nice (even with GUI), they should be able to do something. Like using 
custom file format.
