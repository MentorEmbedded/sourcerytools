<PRE>Hi Vladimir,

I don't know about the original intend of the various access points, but as
far as I am concerned as a user, I have indeed mostly been working with
custom databases that are non-modifiable. I'v only recently started to use
the GUI.

I'd be interested into whether many QMTest users use the interactive GUI mode to
modify test databases, too, as that would give us an indication about what features
to work on. I agree that the GUI can be enhanced a lot.

I'm currently looking into a 'qmtest report' command that reads multiple
result files (potentially from runs on different platforms) and generates an xml
report. In this context I'm interested to know what information should be available
in the report to make it usable. Your suggested expectation annotations seem to
be a good candidate here.

I'd be happy to hear about other suggestions, too.

Thanks,
		Stefan
