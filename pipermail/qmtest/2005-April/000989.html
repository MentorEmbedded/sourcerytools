Fair enough. I'm too not entirely sure if it's best to improve the existing 
GUI, use custom databases, or just my own GUI with PyQt. 

I tend to like the GUI for running tests, at least when developing (nightly 
build surely uses &quot;run + summarize&quot;). However, creation of tests is less 
convenient. Say, I'd like to list a set of source files and automatically 
compute expected results, and create a test. Whether it's better to use 
custom database and a shell script, or standard XML database with some Python 
script that uses QMTest API is the question, though.

&gt;<i> I agree that the GUI can be enhanced a lot. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently looking into a 'qmtest report' command that reads multiple
</I>&gt;<i> result files (potentially from runs on different platforms) and generates
</I>&gt;<i> an xml report. In this context I'm interested to know what information

</I>&gt;<i> expectation annotations seem to be a good candidate here.

Did you look at boost results format?  See:

    <A HREF="http://www.meta-comm.com/engineering/boost-regression/cvs-head/developer/program_options.html">http://www.meta-comm.com/engineering/boost-regression/cvs-head/developer/program_options.html</A>

Essentially, there are several test results which are merged in a big table. 
Each failure can have &quot;notes&quot; -- that's my proposed failure annotations. As 
I've mentioned somewhere in the tracker, the key point is that there's one 
expectation file for all toolsets.

As a related note -- GUI might make perfect sense for such expectation file. 
From time to time somebody commits ill-formed XML expectation file to Boost, 
and all test reporting break ;-)
