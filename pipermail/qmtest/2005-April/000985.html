Hello,
over time, I'm getting more and more dissatisfied with the QMTest GUI. I'll 
start with listing some of the complaints. I have version 2.2.

1. When I start QMTest I see a list of directories. How do I add a new 
directory? There's only &quot;new suite&quot; menu item, but no &quot;new directory&quot;.

2. Say I click on directory &quot;backward&quot; and then click &quot;New test&quot;. The test 
name entry field is empty. If I type &quot;foo&quot;, I get test &quot;foo&quot; created at the 
top-level. The entry field should either be prefilled with &quot;backward.&quot;, or 
the &quot;backward.&quot; should be prepended to the test name at creation time. I was 
hit by this several times already.

3. The drop-down box with test type lists class names. How does some developer 
who did not wrote the test know what test names like &quot;nm_model.Backward2&quot; 
mean? The description is only shown *after* selecting test name *and* 
clicking &quot;Next&quot;.

4. The screen shown after &quot;Run&quot; command is non-ideal. It shows only 10 first 
test results, so in case that I have 100 tests I need to click always &quot;next&quot;.
The summary at the top shown pass/fail counts, but if some tests fail, I don't 
know which one failed -- I need to look at next 10 results, and then on next 
10 results and so on until I see the failing one.

If I rerun a single test, the result is added last, and I'm shown the first 10 
results. Again, I need several clicks just to see the result I'm interested 
in.

5. I can't add annotations to tests, directories or expected failures.

There are some issues caused my HTML + local web server design.

1. The expectations must be manually saved after modification.

2. The GUI feels a bit slow


Most of the above are glitches, not very terrible bugs. But, given that they 
exist for quite some time, I start to wonder how QMTest GUI is supposed to be 
used. Maybe, the idea is that most users will create custom databases and use 
them, directly creating tests in the filesystem/DB/whatever? And GUI is just 
for running tests?
