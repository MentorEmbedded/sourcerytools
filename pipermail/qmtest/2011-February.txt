Hi Mark,
Thank you for your quick reply and offering to answer some technical
questions!?Based on your reply
I assume the concerns from the LLVM mailing list are not?valid, and
that is good.

I have a couple of high-level questions about QMTest:

1. The last update to QMTest was in 2008. Has the current features of
QMTest been
?? ?verified to work correctly on newer and older versions of linux,
windows and Mac OS X?

2. We currently build and test ROSE with autotools
(libtool/automake/autoconf/gmake).
?? ?Our project pass 'make check/distcheck/clean/distclean'. Most of
our tests are functional
?? ?tests?that test specific features with a custom program. The tests
depend on?many test
?? ?programs that are compiled with make.

?? ?Since QMTest has?it's own test runner I imagine there will be some
transition if we are to use
?? ?it. Do you have a?recommended way of using QMTest to test an
autotools project? It would be
?? ?ideal?if you?have an example?or can point?to a project that
implement your recommended way
?? ?of testing. One of my biggest questions?is how?to support libtool
since we don't install libraries or
?? ?programs before building and testing.

3. How is the usability of QMTest when?testing locally on a developers
machine??'make check'?can
?? ?easily run?the tests for a directory at a time,?and if required it
will?automatically rebuild dependencies.

Best,
Andreas

I don't claim to have reviewed all the traffic; just the summary you
posted.  Some of the cons were not accurate; I'm not sure if that's true
of all of them.

No.  We're using it on recent Ubuntu, but not on other systems.

You would certainly have to do some refactoring.  You would end up with
"make check" running "qmtest ..." to actually run the tests, and you'd
want the tests themselves to be organized within QMTest.

QMTest has the concept of a "resource" -- i.e., a set-up step that
occurs before some tests run.

Running "qmtest run" is approximately the same as running "make check"
in that respect.

The basic tradeoff is that you will spend more time setting things up
with qmtest in order to leverage its more-structured environment.

I would not characterize either DejaGNU or QMTest as "products" at this
point; they're useful technologies.  If you want to be successful with
either one, you might want to engage someone to help; otherwise, it's
going to be a fair amount of digging about on your own.
