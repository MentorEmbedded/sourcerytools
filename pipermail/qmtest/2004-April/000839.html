It comes up in old (pre-job control) shells which would do
backgrounding partially by blocking SIGINT in the child process.  I am
not particularly concerned about this either, but it does seem more
abstractly correct to me to record the signal mask at startup (before
creating any threads) and restore that after fork.

I might be inclined to patch the Python core to do this, using
pthread_atfork, except that wouldn't help us.

</I>
I don't see why you need NSIG ... make your module wrap sigset_t
objects, provide the sigaddset/sigdelset/... interface (with less
gruesome names), and the C library will do the checking for you.  Any
platform that has sigprocmask can be assumed to have these (they're
both POSIX.1).
