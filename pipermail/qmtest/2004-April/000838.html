Agreed.  It's only positive feature is that it's better than the
current behaviour, where it's confusing to people at all moments :-)

&gt;<i> I think the best solution would just be to call sigprocmask after fork

</I>
Arguably that would be okay, on the theory that if our caller blocked
our signals, its because they wanted our signals to be blocked.  That
is not a use case I'm particularly worried about, though...

&gt;<i> Since Python does not have &quot;sigprocmask&quot; in its library, this does 
</I>&gt;<i> require adding a non-pure module to QMTest.  That module is already out 
</I>&gt;<i> there; someone has written a &quot;sigmask&quot; module.  We can just incorporate 
</I>&gt;<i> it -- disabling it on Windows, of course.  For now, we can assume that 
</I>&gt;<i> all UNIX systems have &quot;sigprocmask&quot;.
</I>
Where?  The closest I can find is some years old abandonware GPLed
module, that I'm not sure I trust and that I'm not entirely sure we're
license compatible with (since we disagree with the FSF about the use
of proprietary plugins -- i.e., test classes -- in a GPLed program).

I guess it wouldn't be hard to whip up such a module anyway, though.
Is NSIG available cross-platformly?  If so then it's easy to write
set_sigmask()/get_sigmask(); if not then clear_sigmask() is still easy
to write.
