I think the issue here is more conceptual than technical.

For us, a canonical example comes from testing a compiler.  Our 
canonical test is a single file which must be compiled, linked, and 
run.   Success means doing all of that and exiting with exit code zero.  
We could look at that as three separate tests (a compile test, a link 
test, and a run test) with a data dependency -- but we don't because 
users of compilers don't think of it that way.  Either the compiler 
works for that program or it doesn't.  So, we have just one test, but 
the annotations indicate what kind of failure occurred.

Perhaps you could explain your use case and we could see if there's a 
way to do it in QMTest that makes sense?  If not, then we can think 
about what we could do to QMTest to improve it.

Thanks,
