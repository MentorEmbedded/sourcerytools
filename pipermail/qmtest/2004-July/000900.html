</I>&gt;<i> OK, here's a case that I'm dealing with today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our tests exercise a remote device that handles telecom traffic.  
</I>&gt;<i> There are several processes running on it - it's a Unix box - and we 
</I>&gt;<i> hit those processes with network traffic generated on the local host.  
</I>&gt;<i> One of those processes is highly-concurrent and real time; it is 
</I>&gt;<i> crucial to the operation of the system-under-test.  Although it should 
</I>&gt;<i> never crash or hang, it's written in C, so it might.  This process 
</I>&gt;<i> runs throughout the duration of a test session.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a test results in a crash/lockup, we need to know immediately and 
</I>&gt;<i> stop testing.  The test classes themselves could do the &quot;health check&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> but, even if they did, they could not affect the onward movement of 
</I>&gt;<i> the QMTest execution engine; not without making every single test 
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on the one before it, which is not an option for us because 
</I>&gt;<i> the tests are not sequential in nature and may even be randomly shuffled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm toying with the idea of writing a custom execution engine that 
</I>&gt;<i> watches the SUT and does all the necessary monitoring and data 
</I>&gt;<i> gathering in the event of a catastrophic failure.   This engine could 
</I>&gt;<i> also terminate the test loop in the event of said failure.  We've 
</I>&gt;<i> already tweaked cmdline.py a tiny bit to get some SUT information 
</I>&gt;<i> prior to testing so it looks like we're headed down that path...
</I>
That's interesting.

If it weren't for the dynamic nature, you'd use a resource -- it would 
set up the long-running process, and all your tests would depend upon 
that resource.

&gt;<i> We have hundreds of tests that simulate telephone calls.  They are 
</I>&gt;<i> quite self-contained except for a piece of underlying software that 
</I>&gt;<i> requires us to increment a UDP port number for each test.   The new 
</I>&gt;<i> port number must be the number used in the preceding test plus two.
</I>
Also interesting.

I'm going to chew on those a bit, and see what we can come up with.

Thanks,
