</I>&gt;<i> The GetDatabase() method available in all test classes will let you

</I>
Unfortunately, since build directory != source directory in general,
knowing where the test database is stored doesn't actually help that
much :-(.

&gt;<i> Alternatively, you could use the context to tell you where the
</I>&gt;<i> executables are; that's a perfect application for the context.  (The
</I>&gt;<i> idea of the context is to provide information about the test environment
</I>&gt;<i> that might vary over different testsuite invocations.)
</I>
Right, that makes sense to me too.  It still seems like there should
be some more generic way of doing this than defining a special key in
my context and then having my custom Test class look for it.

&gt;<i> The working_directory support that you see littered about in the code
</I>&gt;<i> should actually be removed.  We originally envisioned allowing tests
</I>&gt;<i> to set their working directories, but then realized that does not work
</I>&gt;<i> when running tests in parallel -- working directories are per-process,
</I>&gt;<i> not per-thread.  So, that stuff will be going away as soon as I get
</I>&gt;<i> around to editing the files. :-)
</I>
Oo, good point.  Hmm.  So any generic working directory support should
probably be implemented in the various command tests themselves, via
the &quot;dir&quot; argument to Executable.Run.

I think what I'll do for now is add a some sort of &quot;search path&quot; or
&quot;base directory&quot; attribute to my Test class, and % expand it against
the context; that seems a nice balance of genericity, flexibility, and
simplicity, unless anyone can think of a problem with it...
