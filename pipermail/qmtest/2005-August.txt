Hi ,
I am running some unit tests and few of them are dependent on some hardware. 
I want to check if that hardware is available on the target. Please let me 
know how I can do that. Can I use resource for this purpose if yes How??

Also can any one post example for resource and context.

Thanks for your help.
pankaj

Subject: PATCH: Read DejaGNU log files
Message-ID: <430BE0E9.400@codesourcery.com>

This patch makes QMTest automatically read DejaGNU ".log" files as if 
they were QMTest results files.  One immediate application is that you 
can now do:

   qmtest summarize -O old.log new.log

to get a QMTest-style difference report of new failures.

The resulting Result objects are somewhat impoverished, in that we 
capture the outcome of the test, and the test ID, but do not try to fill 
in any annotations.  DejaGNU log files don't have much structure, so 
trying to do better, with reasonable accuracy, may be hard.

A pleasant side-effect of this patch is that you can now run "qmtest 
summarize" without an actual test database at hand, as nothing really 
required that.  So, viewing old QMTest result files does not require 
having a copy of the database you used handy.

Checked in.
