<PRE>
Last nights' Starbucks hacking:

There was a flaw in the logic for the new combo timeout/redirection
Executable class that could cause things to wait for the timeout to
expire, even when the primary child process was done executing.

Fixed with this patch, which also contains some documentation
improvements.

     needed.  The arguments to the resource class are what make two
     instances of the same resource class different from each other.
     For example, in the case of a resource that sets up a database, the
     records to place in the database might be given as arguments.
     Every resource has a name, using the same format that is used for
!    tests.  It is possible to have a test and resource with the same
!    name; the test and resource namespaces are distinct.&lt;/para&gt;
  
     &lt;para&gt;Under some circumstances (such as running tests on multiple
     machines at once), &qmtest; may create more than one instance of
     the same resource.  Therefore, you should never depend on there
     being only one instance of a resource.  In addition, if you have
     asked &qmtest; to run tests concurrently, two tests may access the
!    same resource at the same time.&lt;/para&gt;
   
     &lt;para&gt;Setting up or cleaning up a resource produces a result, just
     like those produced for tests.  &qmtest; will display these results
     in its summary output and record them in the results file.&lt;/para&gt;
