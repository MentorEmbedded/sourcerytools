Hi,

Is it possible to integrate purify, quantify and pureCoverage with
QMTest? Any pointers for customizing it would be really helpful.

Thanks much in advance for any help!

Alok

QMTest is a test execution harness. It knows or cares very little about 
what the tests actually do. You can certainly use QMTest to run external 
tools on code. Have you looked at the online tutorial 
(http://www.codesourcery.com/public/qmtest/qmtest-snapshot/share/doc/qmtest/html/tutorial/index.html) 
for help on customising / extending ?

A good starting point might be the CompilationTestDatabase 
(http://www.codesourcery.com/public/qmtest/qmtest-snapshot/share/doc/qmtest/html/tutorial/customizing-test-databases.html), 
which considers individual source files as tests that need to be 
compiled and executed correctly, for the test to pass. It should be 
possible to extend that by running the compiled executables through 
another tool such as purify, provided the latter can be run via command 
line, and produces results that can be validated by some custom 
extension script .

Regards,
         Stefan

Hi Stefan,

Thanks for a very prompt reply. I did indeed look into customizing
section of the QMTest tutorial and seems like I didn't really pay much
attention. With your description and having re-read the tutorial on
CompilationTestDatabase I think it should be fairly straightforward to
incorporate it.

Thanks much once again!
Alok
