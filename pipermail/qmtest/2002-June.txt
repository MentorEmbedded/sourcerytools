Thank you for the report.

Strangely, I cannot reproduce this behavior.

What version of QMTest are you using?

Thanks,

There's no way to do that at present, and it's non-trivial to do.

It would be nice to be able to completely restart QMTest from within the
GUI.  One reason to do this is to point it at another test database;
another reason would be to reload test classes.

I'll add this ot the list of things we'd like to do for version 2.0.

Yours,

Subject: QMTest stuck with never ending tests
Message-ID: <B9283EA0.4A48%Gilles.Depeyrot@wanadoo.fr>

Hi,

I am having a problem with QMTest that remains stuck in an endless loop
updating the browser page and displaying:

All tests have not yet been run. These results will be updated every few
seconds.

The first few tests have succeeded and one required to continue has failed
but QMTest just keeps on running... Selecting 'Stop tests' does not change
anything and the only way is to quit QMTest.

Any idea where this might be coming from?

Regards,
Gilles

Subject: Temporary path resource problem
Message-ID: <B928421D.4A4A%Gilles.Depeyrot@wanadoo.fr>

Hi,

I have a shell script test that has a temporary path resource named
'output_path' in the prerequisites. In the shell script test, I change
directory into the temporary directory (using 'cd $QMV_output_path') and
create files for the test.

This works fine the first time I run the tests. However, the second time I
run them, I get an error:

/tmp/@16248.9: cd: no such file or directory: /tmp/@16248.2

I then have to quit QMTest and restart it in order to be able to run my
tests again.

What am I doing wrong?

Regards,
Gilles

Subject: QMTest stuck with never ending tests (2)
Message-ID: <B9292047.4A86%Gilles.Depeyrot@wanadoo.fr>

Hi,

I think I have found how to reproduce the never ending tests problem.

Given the following tests:

A
B (prerequisite tests: A)
C (prerequisite tests: B)

If A fails, then status is:

A FAIL
B UNTESTED
C

And the tests run on and on (apparently because no status is affected to C).

If I change the tests so that:

A
B (prerequisite tests: A)
C (prerequisite tests: A B)

Then if A fails, then status is:

A FAIL
B UNTESTED
C UNTESTED

And the tests finish correctly.

Is it required to give all prerequisite tests or is this a bug? In this
case, shouldn't A be automatically determined as a prerequisite test of C
because of prerequisite test B?

Regards,
Gilles

[snip explanation]

Thank you, I can now reproduce the problem myself with the development
sources.

This would be two bugs.  First, that the A->B->C transitive dependency
isn't recognized.  Second, that the "stop" command from the GUI (or
control-C on "qmtest run") doesn't work.

Stay tuned for a patch.

Could I persuade you to post a recipe for reproducing this, starting
from an empty new test database, please?  (Similar to what you gave
for the A->B->C transitive dependency bug you posted earlier.)

Thanks,

Thank you very much for the detailed bug report.

It is a bug.  We have fixed it in our development sources and this bug
will not be present in QTMest 2.0.

Thanks for trying QMTest.

We've fixed most of the problems you've reported in our current
sourcebase, and all of the problems will be fixed in QMTest 2.0.

Thank you,

Subject: QMTEST_DB_PATH suggestion
Message-ID: <B92F9EF3.4E68%Gilles.Depeyrot@wanadoo.fr>

Hi,

The documentation states that if the QMTEST_DB_PATH variable is set in the
environment, then that database is used, otherwise the current directory is
used. This is fine.

I would like to be able to reference files from the database root directory
in my tests, for instance to use common files in the tests...

I can do this if I set QMTEST_DB_PATH before starting QMTest and use this
variable inside my tests.

However, I have multiple test databases and would like to avoid setting this
variable and instead start QMTest from the database root directory.

So, I suggest that when QMTest uses the current directory as the database,
it automatically set QMTEST_DB_PATH to this directory. In this way, whether
QMTEST_DB_PATH is set in the user environment or by QMTest, it is always set
to the database root directory and available in the tests.

Regards,
Gilles
