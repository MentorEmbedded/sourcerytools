Subject: accessing current qmtest sources?
Message-ID: <87vekwtmf2.fsf@orac.acorntoolworks.com>

Hi Folks,

While working on my targets issues, I found some inconsistencies in
the documentation.  But before reporting them, I tried to update my
workspace just in case they've already been addressed.  But neither 
an update nor a new checkout (using the instructions on
www.codesourcery.com/qmtest/development.html) work, it appears that
cvs is unable to cvs.codesourcery.com and eventually times out.

The inconsistency I found was in section 3.6, "Test Targets".  The
descriptions of ThreadTarget and ProcessTarget speak of a
"concurrency" property, but it appears that "threads" and "processes"
are what's actually used.

Thanks for pointing that out!  We're in the process of converting to a
subversion repository.  However, in the meantime, you can use
"www.codesourcery.com" instead of "cvs.codesourcery.com" with CVS.

Thanks,

Subject: PATCH: Correct handling of DejaGNU UNTESTED results
Message-ID: <200612130525.kBD5PCR2015929@sethra.codesourcery.com>


This patch corrects the handling of DejaGNU UNTESTED results when
generating expectations.  In particular, the expected QMTEST result is
now UNTESTED -- rather than PASS.

Committed.

Subject: qmtest commands and arguments
Message-ID: <4594451A.1040707@sicortex.com>

In reading the html at the tutorial link

http://www.codesourcery.com/public/qmtest/qm-snapshot/share/doc/qmtest/html/tutorial/index.html

I note descriptions of commands -- ls and describe -- as well as command 
arguments -- e.g. qmtest create -id ... -- that are not available in my 
version QMTest 2.3.  There doesn't seem to be a more recent version 
available on the website.

Are these commands only available at the HEAD of the Subversion 
development tree?

Yes, that's correct.
