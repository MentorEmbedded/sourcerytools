Me neither.  It may be tricky to come up with an interface that is as 
tidy as that provided for Tests and Resources, although it does seem 
doable.  For example, the fact that a resource cannot be set up until 
another resource has been cleaned up is clearly something that _RunTests 
could manage.

The other option is to try to find some way to describe these 
dependencies in a generic way that the current execution engine could be 
taught to handle.  In the abstract, that might be even better, but we 
need to figure out what the right formalism is for these dependencies.  
In other words, we need to determine set of things on which a 
test/resource can depend.  At the moment, it can depend on a resource 
being set up, or on another test.  Perhaps all that we need to do is to 
allow tests/resources to depend on a resource being cleaned up.  That 
would also inolve adding a method to Target so that the execution engine 
could demand that a Resource be cleaned up, but that is relatively 
easy.  Thoughts?
