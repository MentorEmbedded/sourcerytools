<PRE>
The LSB project uses qmtest to drive execution of
precompiled tests from the g++ testsuite (the
project itself is referenced here:
<A HREF="http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest/v3_abi_testsuite.html">http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest/v3_abi_testsuite.html</A>)

In some circumstances, the running of the thread
tests in this testsuite cause nasty problems where
qmtest itself takes exceptions.  There don't seem
to be any issues running the test binaries individually
or from a script that runs them in the same sequence
as when run under qmtest, nor has anyone to my
knowledge seen this building-and-running under
dejagnu, which is the native testing framwork.

I'm wondering if there are known issues with running
testcases that do moderately stressful things with
threads under qmtest? Or is this likely to be something
completely different? I don't see anything in the
issue tracker that jumps out at me... proving hard
to trace this as it doesn't happen consistently,
and of course I'm one of the people who can't
reproduce it at all (sigh).

QMTest ERROR in test thread/pthread2.cc
DejaGNUTest.command_1:
