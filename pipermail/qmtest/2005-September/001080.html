I'm not aware of anything in QMTest that would cause this.

The error you give is very weird, as I would think that QMTest would
only get ECHILD if somehow the child process (i.e.,
_thread_pthread2.exe) had somehow been re-parented by the kernel to some
other process.  And, that's not supposed to happen.  My suggestion would
be to run just that test (using &quot;qmtest run name-of-test&quot;) a bunch of
times to see if you can get the error.  If it's reproducible that way,
then, try &quot;strace qmtest run name-of-test&quot; (or &quot;strace -f&quot;) to see if
can figure out what's going on.
