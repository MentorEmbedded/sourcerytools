Subject: Fix for QMTest to make it usable with python 2.4
Message-ID: <420D7A5D.9020901@codesourcery.com>

The attached patch replaces references to the whrandom
module in QMTest by random, as is required to make
it usable with python 2.4.

I'm not exactly sure about side-effects of the change
applied to the 'DocumentTemplate' module. It seems
that file was imported from zope, and is only partially
used in the web frontend, so the change in that case
may have no effect at all (beside not producing
a warning any more).

Regards,
		Stefan

This looks great.

Would you please apply it to the mainline and to the latest release 
branch?  Then, I can show you how to do an update release so that people 
downloading from the web site don't run into this problem.

(Wasn't there another web.py problem that was affecting the release 
branch with Python 2.4?)

Thanks,

Indeed, Some documentation strings are wrong. I will send a patch shortly.
