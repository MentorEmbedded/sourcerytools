Dear All, 


  Can someone please shed some light on the status of QMTest ?  It
appears that the web pages from code sorcery have vanished along with
access to the source and now redirects to the mentor graphics website.



Regards

Daren

Daren,

while there hasn't been any development on QMTest over recent months,
the project is still alive. As a matter of fact, we are right now
exploring ways to move QMTest to a publicly hosted space, in the hopes
to grow its user (and developer !) community.

Thanks,
        Stefan
