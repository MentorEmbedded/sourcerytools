Subject: Target and Groups to restrict Tests
Message-ID: <9B79F49B9ACEE34195E4DFC7F20B13BD3BE1A7@psehpex001.psenterprise.com>


Greetings , 


I've recently started using QMTest and have run into a problem.
I have 4 different machine configurations a. Linux32, b. Linux64 , c.
Windows32 , d. Windows64
Each machine performs a local run of the Test suite, however I want to
limit some tests to only run on Windows32 and Windows64.  I have read
over the Target and Group documentation, but I am still none the wiser
as to how this is possible.  Can someone explain how this can be
accomplished with Targets and Groups ?

If not I suspect that I will modify my custom test classes with boolean
Fields run_on_platform_xxxx and test these at the start of the test, but
I would prefer not to reinvent the wheel if this is already possible.

Any help would be appreciated.

Regards

Daren

It can't. Or rather, that's not what Targets are meant to be used for.
You really want to have different content in your test database, depending
on the platform. Targets, on the other hand, only allow to how to manage
parallel testing.

I think 'run_on_platform_xxxx' isn't really a property of a test per se,
as it is the test database that reports available tests to the user.
I would try to make it such that the databases could figure out
whether a test actually exists on a given platform, without having to
instantiate the associated test class.
That could be done using a FileDatabase, where the decision about what
tests participate in a test suite for a given platform is somehow encoded
in the directory layout, for example. Or by using some helper files
that contain the relevant metadata.

What I do is run qmtest from a script, and the script goes to the target 
machine to determine what the platform is, and based on the platform, 
calls the proper test suite to run.
