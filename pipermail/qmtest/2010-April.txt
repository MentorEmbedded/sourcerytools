Hello
I am new to qmtest and was wandering how to enable tracer capability so that I can see the debug dumps. I have cursorily browsed the python code and figured there are bunch of debug messages guarded by __debug__. The python env set __debug__ to True and thus I expect to see the dumps but no. Any ideas?
Thanks
