<PRE>
This list seems pretty quiet and I hope I'm not generating too much
noise here.  I'm anxious to use QMTest and so I'm trying to report
things that might be useful to the developers and get this tool as
useful and stable as possible.  This is the only way I can help
currently, and I hope that it isn't just too much noise for everyone.
Please forgive if I'm asking questions that could be answered by RTFM or
by doing an appropriate search of the archives.  

I've been searching like this:

<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=rsh_target+site:codesourcery.com">http://www.google.com/search?q=rsh_target+site:codesourcery.com</A>

Speaking of the archives, I noticed that all the email addresses had
been xxx'ed out.  Thanks, Mark.  Hopefully this reduces the spam level
somewhat.

I thought I had seen a message in the archives from someone who was
debugging QMTest and had an easy way to debug it.  I couldn't find it
recently when I did a search.  Any suggestions on how to set a
breakpoint etc?

Thanks for the help.

 -- John
