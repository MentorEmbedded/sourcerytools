<PRE>I'm happy to report that the people that I work for (my 'customers') are
happy with the results that I am getting from QMTest so far.
Congratulations to the team that put it together and my compliments on a
fine tool.
 
I have fielded a few questions and requests for features that I do not
know how to implement, and I'm coming here for some guidance.
 
The number one request I get from my customers for a new test harness is
a history of test results.  
 
Specifically, when I use the GUI to view the results of a test run,
there are three columns: 'Test', 'Outcome', 'Expectation', and
'Details'.  One suggestion was to remove the 'Details' column and make
the 'Outcome' column perform the duty of the 'Details' column.  That
would leave room for more outcomes to be reported.  Specifically, I was
requested to provide a history of outcomes.  My customers want to be
able to compare at a glance the results of this test run with a test run
from last night and last week, and possible others, including any data
or statistics gathered from any of those test runs.
 
Has this been done by someone else already?  Is this a customization I
can do or do I have to make some changes to QMTest itself?  
 
I received another request to be able to run tests multiple times.
Perhaps provide a field that lets a user provide a count for the number
of times to run this test or this suite.  Any thoughts on whether it
would make sense to put a count field at the beginning of each
test/suite whose default is one?
