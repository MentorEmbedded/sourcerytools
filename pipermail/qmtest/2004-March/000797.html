<PRE>Hi Mark,

I am investigating the possibility that I am not building the Windows
installation correctly.  I have been doing that by running &quot;python
./setup.py bdist_wininst&quot; under Linux, and then running the resultant
.exe file under Windows.  So I think the first thing I need to do is
make sure I am building under Linux correctly.

[as an aside, could you describe to me how you build the windows
installation of the CVS code?  I would like to duplicate that and see
what happens]

I have installed Python 2.3 in my user space under Linux, and I'm pretty
sure that was working with the release version of QMTest.  However, when
I specify this python interpreter when building the cvs code, the
resulting qmtest script won't run.

Example:

./configure --with-python=/home/afunk/Python-2.3/python
--prefix=/home/afunk/qm
make
make install

The resultant qmtest script has the following first line:

#!/usr/local/bin/python

My system has no python interpreter at this location.  I can still run
the qmtest script by running &quot;python ./qmtest&quot;, but this is not
desirable and I wonder what the problem is.

There is a python 2.2 interpreter in my default path, and I have been
allowing qmtest to use it by not specifying a --with-python parameter to
configure.  When I do this the resultant qmtest script will run.
However I wonder if I am running into some compatibility problems
between 2.2 and 2.3, or between Linux and Windows....

As usual I have asked a lot of questions so hopefully you can sort
through it all!

Thanks,
Andy

I can't think of what could be going wrong here, other than either 
firewalling or a botched installation that caused you to be missing the 
template for submit-test -- but even then, I would expect you to get a 
Python traceback in your browser.

Are you still having this problem?
