QMTest does not presently provide any authentication.  There are several
things that would need to change to support that.  First, there would
have to be some kind of locking protocol to prevent multiple users from
running tests at the same time, or to actually support multiple
simultaneous test executions.  Second, an authentication module would
have to be added.  That's certainly posible, but it would be a fair
amount of work.
