Subject: creating targets for rsh based remote operation
Message-ID: <43F35E69.8090508@cox.net>

Hello QMTest Developers,

We are currently implementing a test harness framework for our CFD code, 
MFIX (www.mfix.org) using QMTest.
Due to the amount of time required for some cases to complete we will be 
utilizing several other nodes in a mini cluster.
So we wanted to create targets to be specified in *.qmt files however we 
are having problems.

The hostname of the system to run the case is 'n2' and we tried the 
following:
qmtest create-target -a remote_shell=/usr/bin/rsh n2 rsh_target.RSHTarget
this seems to generate a QMTest/target file.
When we give the target in the appropriate location within the test 
definition, we get a response the target is not defined.

Is there a site or text that demonstrates with examples how targets can 
be defined and how they can be specified within the tests?
We will also need this rsh based remote job execution probably when 
running parallel jobs with mpirun on a number of nodes?

Thanks.

Subject: Display order of session results in QMTest
Message-ID: <457AE99BD6297242B9487FF7BE3243426B4616@il-tlv-mail03.comverse.com>

Hello. Our team is developing a testing tool based on QMTest.
We have several questions:
1) What is display order of tests results on results display page which
is seen after all tests in the session have been executed?
2) What determines display order of tests results in Reports?
3) Is there any way to change order in which tests are displayed in
Reports - for example, sort tests by name, or execution order?
 
Thank you in advance.
Evgeni Nudelman.

Subject: debugging qmtest with pdb
Message-ID: <BAY109-F1185A97E3E8152F786F1A49EF60@phx.gbl>

Hi,
I have tried to step through qmtest using the pdb debugger.
The problem I have is that when running with pdb, I get exceptions thrown
that I don't have when running only with python.

Are the active qmtest developers using pdb, or are there any known problems 
with this.

regards,
Claes

I have never seriously used pdb so far, sorry. What problem are you trying
to debug ? What exceptions do you see (with and without pdb) ?

Thanks,

I believe the order simply reflects the order in which execution of the
respective tests terminates, which may vary depending on how you run them
(In parallel ? With --random option ?).

> 2) What determines display order of tests results in Reports?

That's a good question. The 'tree' format uses the ordering the
actual test database reports when queried. The 'flat' format simply
reflects the order in the results file(s).

There isn't right now. The idea is that the report file isn't something
users are expected to look at directly. Instead, it is expected to be
post-processed into some output format, such as an online html report.

This post-processing may be a simple matter of running an xslt stylesheet
over the report, but it may also involve an arbitrary number of other,
more involved, steps. However, I admit that the report format isn't
very well documented / specified right now. Would you mind filing an
enhancement request ?

Thanks,

Subject: File Attachment line endings mangled
Message-ID: <A38E2B73AFE64542931B589AAD9644EF0104BEB9@msgusawmb03.ads.autodesk.com>

We're using QMTest to automate the testing of a web API. I've written a
resource class that is used to copy test files to the server under test.
My current development is done on Windows, but I will need to support
*nix going forward.
 
The problem I'm facing is that, when the file attachments (all text) are
copied to the attachment store in the test database, something is
mangling the files: files that use a Unix line-end are copied to the
store unmolested, but files with a DOS line-end (CRLF) end up with
mangled line ends (i.e. the CRLF seems to be reversed to a LFCR). As a
result, the tests fail.
 
I've tried tracing through the source, but, being a Python neophyte, I'm
getting lost before finding the likely cause.
 
My guess is that there is some issue with the HandleUploadRequest method
when used with DOS line ends, but I've reached the limits of my
understanding.
 
Can anyone offer a hint as to where I should look to solve this problem?
 
Cheers,
Ken Horovatin

Aytekin,

I'm sorry for the late reply.

Right.

Tests have a 'target_group' attribute that you can set. Targets, on
the other hand, belong to target groups. I suspect that you tried to set
the name of the host ('n2') where the target group was expected.

To set up a target for a particular group you should use

qmtest create-target -a remote_shell=/usr/bin/rsh n2 rsh_target.RSHTarget some_group

Then you may set your test's target_group value to 'some_group'.

The documentation at

http://www.codesourcery.com/public/qmtest/qm-2.3/manual.html/sec-qmtest-concepts.html#sec-targets

is all we have for the moment. Sorry.

HTH,
		Stefan

I haven't (needed to) in ages, but when I first started, the main
problem was the QM_HOME etc. environment variables - it was easier to
just import pdb and put pdb.set_trace() in the code of my own that I
was debugging, if I remember it correctly...
