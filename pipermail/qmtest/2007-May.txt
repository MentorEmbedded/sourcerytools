Hi,

My name is yaniv and I am begginers in QMTest .
I have ran a test and as a  part of the report result indicate the time
when the test start as follow :

Qmtest.start_time:
2007-05024T08:39:31Z

The QMTest run on linux 

So when I look at the time when the test run with command "date"

The results is 11:39 

There is a difference of 3 hs between 08:39 and 11:39 

How to adjust the Qmtest time to linux time .Pls advice

Thanks in advance

That is because QMTest reports times in UTC, while what your 'date' call
reports is in your local timezone (i.e. +3).

Spector,

please use the QMTest mailing list for questions related to QMTest.

I don't think writing your own test classes only to be able to store
start and end time in a different way is a sensible thing to do.
Rather, as I suggested, you should access (and modify) these times
in the generated results file. They are stored as annotations to each
result.

Let's assume you have a results file (typically '.qmr') generated by 'qmtest run...'.
Here are some lines of python to open such a file, and iterate over individual
results:

rom qm.test import base
from qm.test.result import Result

input = base.load_results(open('results.qmr', 'rb'), None)

for r in input:
    print '%s: start time: %s, end time: %s'\
          %(r.GetId(), r.get('qmtest.start_time'), r.get('qmtest.end_time'))


Please find details concerning the ResultStream and Result API in
the (online) API Reference Manual.

Regards,
		Stefan

Message-ID: <1180532723.4762.6.camel@sanjoy-desktop>

Hi Sir,

I am using command.ExecTest class to test one executable.
We need to give expected stdout, expected stderr and exit code in this
case.I want to ignore expected stdout, expected stderr.I mean whatever
may be the stdout or stderr , testcase will pass or fail depending on
the exit code only.

Can you please tell me , how can customize qmtest to the above
requirement? In which .py file i need to comment out those checks?

Thanks and regards,

You may provide your own test class (deriving from command.ExecTest)
that provides an empty ValidateOutput() method (returning []).

See ExecTest.ValidateOutput() in qm/test/classes/command.py.
