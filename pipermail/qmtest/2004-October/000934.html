<PRE>Hi,

First of all, I would like thank you for the wonderful product. We use 
QMTest as our primary test harness for Firebird database engine QA 
(firebird.sourceforge.net) for some time, and we're more than happy with 
it. The sole issue we have with QMTest so far is lack of unicode support 
in tests, and unicode-awareness in QMTest. 

Thanks to modularity and extensibility of QMTest, we were able to develop 
support to run tests written in Python (2.3) with use of unicode and 
include unicode support for various types of fields we need for that, 
without direct changes to QMTest source code. Although it works, one 
important issue remains. Because QMTest itself is not unicode-aware, it 
can't show in GUI.(CLI is another story) any annotation that contains 
unicode characters. Because GUI part is based on ZOPE, I think that this 
could be amended if QMtest would be upgraded to use new ZOPE code (ZOPE 
should support unicode starting from v2.6, and current stable release is 
v2.7).

We need the unicode support really badly, and I guess that other QMtest 
users would also benefit from it. Because QMTest is an open source 
project, we understand that we have to take some responsibility to make 
it happen. Unfortunately, this task is too complex for us to handle it 
with our limited resources, at least without help. So, I would like ask 
you for help and guidance to make QMtest unicode-aware, or if it's 
already in your to-do list or development, we would like offer you a 
helping hand to implement it as soon as possible.

Best regards
Pavel Cisar (ICQ: 89017288)
