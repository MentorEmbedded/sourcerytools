Subject: pexpect like features in QMtest
Message-ID: <9453F12FE339914BB724289B992AEEB403599B9268@34093-MBX-C04.mex07a.mlsrvr.com>

Is there any feature in QMTest which allows running program and watching output? I have looked in the class definitions of qmtest but haven't been able to find one out yet. Essentially, I wanted to have features like expect/pexpect. I was trying to see whether QMTest already has support for pexpect like features. If yes, then I want to leverage that as opposed to using pexpect.
Thanks

Ahsan,

QMTest right now doesn't have any builtin support for driving 
interactive programs with expect. I can definitely see that being 
useful, though, and would be glad to incorporate any support for it, if 
you are willing to contribute a patch to that effect.

Thanks,
         Stefan

Thanks Stefan for the quick response!
For our specific example, we want to control our embedded system (serial/network connection with host) and want to automate the user's sending command and watching output in qmtest script. We are thinking of installing probably a freeware on our linux host that will redirect RS232 data over ssh. If we can find one then we are thinking of using qmtest's ssh/rsh classes to control our DUT.
