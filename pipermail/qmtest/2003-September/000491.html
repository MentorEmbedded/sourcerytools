&gt;<i> I'd be fine with both. Actually, I'm aware that the current MANIFEST
</I>&gt;<i> template is too inclusive. That's partly because I don't fully understand
</I>&gt;<i> the current directory structure and partly because I hope that once this
</I>&gt;<i> build system is fully working we could clean the layout up a bit, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> make the source tree more isomorphic to an installed tree. Then the
</I>&gt;<i> MANIFEST.in would be straight forward and clean.
</I>
We could also go to the other extreme, via something like:

  cvs export -d tmp 
  (cd tmp; find . -type f) &gt; MANIFEST.in

Having to manually update MANIFEST.in seems bad, and using wildcards
seems dangerous, and the thing I suggest here seems cumbersome.

&gt;<i> For a temporary solution it would probably be most efficient if you fixed
</I>&gt;<i> that file as you know best which files are official and which are not.
</I>
I think the file is OK, it is just that it is only safe to use it in a
completely virgin checkout.

&gt;<i> yeah, I now remember that from RH 8, and found a solution at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rpm.org/hintskinks/rpmbuild/">http://www.rpm.org/hintskinks/rpmbuild/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'v been running RH 9.0 for a while, and there it works again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, if this turns out to be a problem I have to extend the 'bdist_rpm'
</I>&gt;<i> command to use 'rpmbuild' instead.
</I>
I think we should do that.  RH 8 is going to be around for a while, and
&quot;rpmbuild&quot; will work on all future systems, presumably, so by doing a
little extra work we make things more reliable for our users.
 
&gt;<i> Well, I would suggest to rename/move the 'qmtest.py' file then (and others),
</I>&gt;<i> so yes, the man pages need to be adjusted accordingly. Speaking of the
</I>&gt;<i> windows executable: I'd very much like to make it (at least optionally)
</I>&gt;<i> install two scripts: one that can be run from the windows cmd, the other
</I>&gt;<i> from a cygwin shell. I believe the latter could be a tiny wrapper shell
</I>&gt;<i> script, so not a big deal.
</I>
That makes sense.

&gt;<i> Can I check it in then with these changes applied or do you prefer another
</I>&gt;<i> patch first ?
</I>
It's OK to check it in.  Normally, we try hard to avoid having
unfinished work in CVS, but we've already started down this road with
distutils, so I think it makes sense to keep going in that way.

Thanks,
