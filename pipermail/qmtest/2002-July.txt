1) Is this mailing list archived? It's polite to
check the archives before asking a question. It may
have been recently answered.

2) What are the configuration steps to allow the
qmtest webserver (Zope?) to accept external HTTP
requests? I'd like to browse the database from other
machines.

3) The User's Guide is well done. Is there also a
Programmer's Guide or something that describes how the

Thanks.

There's an archive here:

  http://www.codesourcery.com/archives/qmtest/maillist.html

You just have to do:

  qmtest gui -A a.b.c.d

For example, if your machine's IP address is "206.168.99.1" you would do:

  qmtest gui -A 206.168.99.1

Then, you sould be able to connect to the server from other machines.
When you do "qmtest gui" it will print out a URL you can use to connect

See this URL for more information on the option:

The latter.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0207221825210.7287-100000@nondot.org>


Ok, so I'm working my way through Chapter 2 of the qmtest manual, trying
to run tests with the gui.  When I get to Section 2.3 of the manual (ie,
choose "run all tests"), Netscape [Netscape 4.79/U.S., 17-Oct-01; (c)
1995-2000 Netscape Communications Corp.] just enters an infinite loop,
periodically updating the page, but with no progress.  This is the meat of
the page that I have:

  <p><span class="warning">All tests have not yet been run.  These
 results will be updated every few seconds.</span></p>

 <table class="data" width="100%">
  <caption>Statistics</caption>
     <tr class="heading">
    <th width="16%">Outcome</td>
    <th width="21%"># of Tests</td>
    <th width="21%">% of Total</td>
    <th width="21%"># Unexpected</td>
    <th width="21%">% of Total</td>
   </tr>
                                                                      <tr
class="field">
    <td><span class="outcome">Total</span></td>
    <td align="right">0</td>
    <td align="right">100</td>
    <td align="right"
                >0</td>
    <td align="right"
         >
           &nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
   </table>

   <table class="data" width="100%">
   <caption>
        Test Results
       </caption>
   <tr class="heading">
    <th width="60%">Test</td>
    <th width="10%">Outcome</td>
    <th width="10%">Expectation</td>
    <th width="10%">Details</td>
   </tr>
     </table>

I can run tests from the command line just fine, so I think that the core
part of QMtest is ok, but the GUI is definately not happy.  I can go look
at individual tests and dink around with other parts just fine.  The main
"home" page shows all three tests with no problem.

How do I go about figuring out what's wrong here?  QMtest looks like a
cool tool, but if I can't get the GUI working, it's going to be hard to
convince my developers to use it...

Thanks for the help!!

Subject: make install bug
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0207221659060.6658-100000@nondot.org>


I'm having a problem with qm-1.1.5 'make install' on a solaris box:

...
for tool in test; do \
  if test -e qm/$tool/classes/classes.qmc; then \
    ./install-sh -c -d -m 755 "/home/vadve/lattner/cvs/qmtest-1.1.5/lib/qm/qm/$tool/classes"; \
    ./install-sh -c -m 644 qm/$tool/classes/classes.qmc \
      "/home/vadve/lattner/cvs/qmtest-1.1.5/lib/qm/qm/$tool/classes/classes.qmc"; \
  fi; \
done
/bin/sh: test: argument expected
gmake: *** [lib-install] Error 1

I'm sure this is a really trivial problem to fix, but I don't know
anything about bourne shell scripting... so, I appeal to you guys.  :)

If it matters, I configured with:
./configure --prefix=/home/vadve/lattner/cvs/qmtest-1.1.5

If you need any other information, I'd be happy to provide it.

On a side note, are there any archives of the mailing list available
somewhere?  I'm sure this question has come up before, but there are no
archives listed off of the qmtest dev page:
http://www.codesourcery.com/qm/qmtest_development

QMTest looks like a nifty tool, I look forward to being able to try it
out.

Ok, I fixed/hacked it by changing lined 348 of GNUmakefile to:
          if /usr/bin/test -e qm/$$tool/classes/classes.qmc; then \
from
          if test -e qm/$$tool/classes/classes.qmc; then \

I guess the built in bash 'test' does not support -e.

Ok, I found the archives, but it would still be nice to have them listed
off that page.  :)

Thanks for pointing that out.  We've updated the Makefile so that
the next release of QMTest will not have that problem.

I think I know what bug this is.  I know that we have fixed it in the
mainline CVS sources, so the fix will be available in the next version
of QMTest.

Message-ID: <A98D21351AE3D511B6140060979801B403EAC2@oreh.hermes.si>

Hello everybody.
I'm a begginer with QmTest and python. I want to write one test case with
python class and I don't know how. I was looking into documentation, but I
do not understand (I think) the most important part. I write my class, which
inherit Test class, but when I want to import TEST modul I got message that
TEST modul do not has Test attribute. I have TEST module in path therefore
python can find it.
 
Can anyone send me one example of how to write python class, which I can
include it into QmTest tool.
 
Thanks in advance
    
        Andrej

Do you have any idea when that will be, and if not, is the mainline CVS
version stable enough to use?

I suggest you start by copying:

  /usr/local/lib/qm/qm/test/classes/python.py

and inserting your class in there.  That's a good template for how to
write a QMTest test class.

It is stable enough to use, in my experience.  There are individual days
when that is not true -- but we are busily writing more QMTest tests for
QMTest in an effort to improve the stability!
