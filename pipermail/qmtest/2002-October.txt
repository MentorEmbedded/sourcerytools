Subject: some qmtest questions for the community
Message-ID: <000001c26956$b38d48c0$196fa8c0@usys.com>

1) Can qmtest gui (zope) be configured to support https? Pointers?

2) Can it be configured to do basic (username + password) authenication?

3) It appears that Zope is used to present the gui and to expand
templates
   as they're served up. Is an apache + mod_python a useful alternative?
   I know more about configuring Apache than zope.

4) Finally, the requirement that qmtest talk to qmtest_remote for
queuing up
   tests on remote targets appears onerous, especially when there are
several
   target machines (you have to install python and qmtest on every
potential target).
   How difficult would it be to use only ssh as the transport and have
qmtest marshal
   up the test results on the server machine? Is this doable?
Ridiculous? I don't know
   enough about what's happening under the covers to judge...

Just thinking...

Hi,

I have a dependency set up with some tests which I am experimenting with 
and I run into the following error...

I have pairs of scripts in the same directory: a build and a exec.  The 
exec depends on the build, but when I try to run them, nothing happens.  
I can go and run the build manually and then try to run the exec... the 
build will work just fine.  But the exec that depends on it will not do 
anything... no error message... nothing.

Any help which could be provided is much appreciated!  I'm at a loss 
right now =(

Thanks!
   -Will

Subject: Finding test db location from tests
Message-ID: <3DA308A5.6090307@cs.msu.su>


I've posted this question some time ago, but nothing was decided, so I'm 
trying again. I would like to be able to find the location of test db in
test's 'run' method. I need it in order to appropriately set search 
paths, find binaries in the working copy, etc. That is, I want to test 
binary located in $(tdb_location)/../bin, etc.

The only way now, is to pass the location via context. This has the 
problem that you need to create that context file, and the content is 
different for different working copies. (I cannot use relative paths 
there, because I don't know the base path for them). This is inconvenient.

I think, the only change needed is to allow test classes find the test 
db used -- test db has 'GetRoot' method already. Is this possible?

TIA,
Volodya

I am evaluating testing tools and QMTest is on my list.  I've read the
User's Guide and Reference but I still have a few questions.
1. Will QMTest work with Web Applications?
2. If yes, how? Are any example tests available?

Could you elaborate?

Other than the existing tutorial, I don't think so.
 
If you want to test say internet explorer interacting with
http://www.jnj.com/, I don't think
qmtest will do that. If you want to issue your own http requests to a
website and then compare
the html etc that you get back with what you expect, then qmtest could
conceivably do that,
although you'd have to fill in the blanks with a supporting utility like
curl or writing a new kind
of test class.
 
Others might have a more definitive answer...

I've checked in patches on the mainline sources that given every test
class access to a "GetDatabase" method that can be used to locate the
test database.  Would you mind trying that out and seeing if it works
for you?

The GUI isn't really ZOPE -- it just uses DTML to do the generation of
HTML for the pages it serves.  The server is built in.

At present, that makes it pretty limited, and, if authentication is
required, problematic.  You could, of course, hide it behind an
Apache proxy, and do the authentication there.

We'd like to enhance the GUI to provide better authentication, but
that's not going to happen in the near term, unless a customer
specifically asks for it.

You need Python on the target machine for fully general test classes.

If you just want to run scripts and such you don't.  In that case, you'd
want to soup up the current script-execution test classes to do
"ssh", and you'd use that rather than the remote support in QMTest itself.

Hello,
now, if extension class contains a syntax error, then QMTest would just 
say that this class is "not found", which makes it hard to understand 
where in extension class the syntax error is. The attaches patch fixes 
this. I'm not happy with error message formatting --- there are some 
extra newlines, but I don't know how to fix it.

Did you try the new "qmtest register" command?

This is the command used to register extension classes, and it should
already give you a traceback if your extension class is invalid.

I was not aware of this command. It's very good that it appears. 
However, even after I register a class, I can still edit it, and get 
unclear error message. Moreover, the class may be edited by someone who 
has no idea about 'register'.

I've tried a different approach, adding the same reporting logic in 
QMTEst.__ExecuteRun as is in QMTest.__ExecuteRegister, so that errors in
extension are reported during runs. Do you think it's reasonable?

(The patch is attached)

Subject: [PATCH] Attachment support
Message-ID: <3DB7DC92.3030003@cs.msu.su>


I've just tried to make a test class that uses attachements and it did 
not work. First, when I create a test, the attachments are not copies to
AttachmentStore for the database. Second, when creating values for 
attachement attributes, None is passed as attachement store to 
AttachementField.GetValueFromDomNode, which makes attachments data 
unsulable.

I've fixed both problems with the patch I'm sending, so now at least 
basics work. There are several problems yet:
1. I don't handle storing of resources with attachments
2. Attachments are never removed
3. Paths to attachments are absolute, meaning it's impossible to move 
test databases around.

Anyway, is it possible to look at the patch, check if it's OK, and 
apply? I'll probably address other issues when I have time.

The only issue is that attachments are never removed. Any chances this
