That's fine, if you can make it work.

However, we don't want to assume the user is installing the binary
package on some nicely configured GNU/Linux box.

Imagine it's a HP-UX or AIX box, with no Python (or, worse, an old
broken Python) installed.  

Just getting Python *built* correctly on such a box is hard; ask Zack
about that. :-)  So, we want to distribute Python binaries along with
QMTest, and the installation procedure for the combined package should
be:

  gunzip qmtest-x.y-binary.tar.gz
  tar xvf qmtest-x.y-binary.tar

The user shouldn't have to modify their PATH, configuration files, etc.

For example, that's why we don't just want to pick the Python in the
user's path.  There's a good chance the Python in the user's path is
broken, old, or wrong in this situation.  The &quot;find the Python next to
QMTest&quot; trick in qm.sh is designed precisely for this case.

It would be fine to make using that trick optional (so that on a nicely
set up Debian box it wasn't necessary, for example), but we can't
eliminate it -- unless somebody can come up with a better plan.

&gt;<i> &gt; The high-level concept is that while we'd like QMTest to play better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with Python, we want to keep it usable as an independent application as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> independent in the sense that it is bundled together with a python distro
</I>&gt;<i> such that there are no external dependencies ?
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> How do you package python then ? It sounds all you need for this case
</I>&gt;<i> is an installer that first unpacks python at a specific place and then
</I>&gt;<i> calls the python binary with the 'setup.py' script that is part of the
</I>&gt;<i> QMTest distribution.
</I>
It's possible that could work.  

If there were one more step added to the installation procedure above,
like, say:

  qmtest-x.y/bin/python qmtest-x.y/share/setup.py

That would be OK.

We're not particular about how exactly this works, but it must work in
such a way that a newbie user/sysadmin can easily get QMTest installed.

It's like those Apple adds for the I-mac -- &quot;There is no step 3.&quot; :-)
