hmm, I thought to eliminate configure, too.

</I>
could you elaborate a bit on that ? Usually when distributing binary
packages, there isn't any configure script (involved any more).

&gt;<i> The high-level concept is that while we'd like QMTest to play better

</I>
independent in the sense that it is bundled together with a python distro
such that there are no external dependencies ?

How do you package python then ? It sounds all you need for this case
is an installer that first unpacks python at a specific place and then
calls the python binary with the 'setup.py' script that is part of the
QMTest distribution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>main executable could be a python script, and some little experimentation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>suggests that the qm/test/qmtest.py file is almost ready to serve, i.e.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>the qmtest.[bat, sh] files aren't really needed then.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is also a desirable goal.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, the logic where by qmtest.sh finds a version of Python
</I>&gt;<i> installed in /path/to/qmtest/bin is required for the set-up above. 
</I>
the 'python setup.py build' command usually replaces the
'#! /usr/bin/env python' line in all installed scripts with the
real path to the python interpreter you use for the installation.
Sounds like that would meet your requirement.


&gt;<i> Therefore, something has to be done to preserve that behavior, or
</I>&gt;<i> something equivalent.
</I>
see above.
