Certainly, if distutils can do the whole job, we'd prefer that.

We started out with &quot;make&quot; several years ago (when Python 1.5 was our
standard version of Python and distutils was a separate module); nobody
has ever tried to go back and eliminate make.

&gt;<i> &gt; The default installation would put the modules under python's site-packages,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the rest into /usr/local/[share, bin], which is what I would expect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from a typical debian / rpm package.
</I>
Yes, that sounds right.

&gt;<i> &gt; And for those who want everything in a single isolated place, an installation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using the '--home' parameter would probably do the trick. In any case, the
</I>
&quot;./configure --prefix&quot; should still have that effect.

That's very important because one mode in which QMTest is distributed is
as a tarball containing binaries for both QMTest and Python.  That's
important for users on systems where Python isn't installed by default.

The high-level concept is that while we'd like QMTest to play better
with Python, we want to keep it usable as an independent application as
well.

&gt;<i> &gt; main executable could be a python script, and some little experimentation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggests that the qm/test/qmtest.py file is almost ready to serve, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the qmtest.[bat, sh] files aren't really needed then.
</I>
That is also a desirable goal.  

However, the logic where by qmtest.sh finds a version of Python
installed in /path/to/qmtest/bin is required for the set-up above. 
Therefore, something has to be done to preserve that behavior, or
something equivalent.

Perhaps playing these kind of games with the script:

  #! /bin/sh exec $0

(with something more advanced) would work.
