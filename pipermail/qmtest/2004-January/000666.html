Are you sure you're raising an exception and catching it?  I would
hazard a guess that something different about your environment is
causing ssh to not even both prompting for a password directly.

ssh(1):

  If ssh needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the
  current terminal if it was run from a terminal.  If ssh does not
  have a terminal associated with it but DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS are
  set, it will execute the program specified by SSH_ASKPASS and open
  an X11 window to read the passphrase.

I would hazard a guess that yeah, somehow ssh is not hooked up to a
terminal, and that's triggering the above check.  I have no idea _why_
ssh wouldn't be hooked up to a terminal -- shouldn't pexpect be taking
care of that? -- but that's probably what's going on.  I certainly
don't know what QMTest would be doing to break pexpect.
