<PRE>Hi Mark,

given that I have no idea what your plans are for the next release,
which new features to expect etc., may I come back to an old
thread here...

I believe having such classes would be a huge win in usability, if only
due to the self-documentation that would add (people could see how to
set up their own code that does similar things).

How much work would you expect such a merge to be ? What ramifications
would that have for existing qmtest users ?

And again, I believe a set of example test databases / test classes
that demonstrate all this functionality would greatly help to make
people proficient with qmtest.

I'd volunteer to work on the integration (with a little guidance from
you). Please let me know whether you are interested, and what timeframe
you have in mind (pre- or post- 2.1 release ?).

Kind regards,
		Stefan
