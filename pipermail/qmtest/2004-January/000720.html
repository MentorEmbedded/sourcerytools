The way that QMTest is designed to handle that situation is via use of a custom test database.

The custom test database looks at all of the tests, and then creates the duplicates itself, programmatically, so that you do not have to do so.  That is similar to what
MountDatabase does (see classes/mount_database.py) but not precisely the same.  You would want to look at each included test and make two copies, probably in different implicit logical directories, and set different context variables for the two different sets of tests.

We've written code that does that duplication several times, but never in a way that was sufficiently general to merit inclusion in QMTest itself.  I'll add that to our list of requested enhancements.  

For the time being (assuming you don't want to hire us to write the code for you!), I'd suggest looking at MountDatabase and seeing if you can figure out how to do that
yourself.  Alternatively, as a quicky-and-dirty hack, you could use XML processing to simply duplicate the tests you've got, programmatically, before running the tests.  We use XML as a storage format precisely to make this kind of thing possible.

Yours,
