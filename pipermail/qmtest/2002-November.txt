What version of QMTest are you using?

Subject: [PATCH] Add 'run this test'  menu item to results page
Message-ID: <3DD249CF.9060100@cs.msu.su>


Hello,
I constantly encounter this situation: a test fails,
I click on "details" to find out what happened, fix
something and want to rerun the test. Now, I have to
click on test name and then select "Run -> This test".

I believe it's much more convenient to add this menu
item also to the result page, and the attaches patch
does it.

Is this reasonable?

Yes, this is a very good idea.  Once we get your paperwork, we'll
put this in.

We haven't completely implemented that yet.  A partial nested-database
can be found in QMTest's CVS tree, in tests/QMTest/selfdb.py.  It is
incomplete on two counts: first, it's read-only, even if the
sub-databases aren't; second, the list of sub-databases is wired into
the source code.  And there might be other problems.  But give it a
whirl and let us know what you think.

Subject: qmtest 1.1.5 bug 
Message-ID: <3DE24025.2090809@enea.se>

Hi,

There is a problem with tests that have dependencies to unknown tests in 
qmtest 1.1.5. According to the manual such dependencies shall be 
silently ignored but that is not the case if the test is run by "qmtest 
run", instead a KeyError exception is raised from the execution engine. 
Below is a patch that takes care of that exception.

Regards,
Sven Lundblad

Thanks for the patch.

We've already fixed this problem on the mainline sources, and hope to
release QMTest 2.0 soon.  That version will include the fix, as well
as a lot of other robustness improvements.

(We're hoping that the 3.0 series will have a lot of major functionality
improvements; the 2.0 series contains mostly robustness and core
functionality improvements.)

Sounds great, looking forward to it!

Are you guys planning to set up some sort of bug tracking tool that can be 
accessed from the web? If so then that would be nice.

I checked in this patch.

Two notes for the future:

(1) We put two lines betwen functions, so:

    +        self.run_menu_items.append(("This Test", "run_test();"))
    +
    +    def MakeRunUrl(self):

    needed another blank line.

(2) Please submit a ChangeLog entry with your patch so that we can see
    what you're changing at a glance.

Thanks!

We'd like to do this, but I'm not sure when it will happen...

OK, noted.

OK. I kinda dislike GNU ChangeLog style, because it omits the
purpose of the changes and describes only individual file tweaks, but
I guess I can just sumbit "full" changelog and let you pick the
parts that's needed.
