Subject: Python 2.5 support?
Message-ID: <3F62CBEE02D6404E98C65934617EB582019CBD98@fmsmsx414.amr.corp.intel.com>


portions of qmtest (external/DocumentTemplate,
which I gather is imported code) make use of the
regex module, deprecated in Python 2.4 and absent
in 2.5 in favor of re.

Ran into this on Ubuntu Feisty which has 2.5
as the default, and has a qm package; also
seems to still be the case in the svn repo.

Any thoughts towards eliminating the use of
this module to make qmtest cleaner for 2.5?

I'm looking into upgrading the DocumentTemplate
module right now. Unfortunately this is a bit
involved, as the regex & re modules differ in
subtle ways, and the current DocumentTemplates from
Zope drags in a lot of dependencies from other
Zope modules, so upgrading whole-sale isn't really
an option.

Thanks,

Your system is lacking the package that contains Python.h.
Depending on what platform you are on, you may have to

1) install a 'python' package first.
2) install a 'python-devel' package.
3) download, compile, and install a python source package.

		Stefan

Subject: patch: Upgrade DocumentTemplate package for python 2.5 compatibility.
Message-ID: <45CD160A.5040303@codesourcery.com>

The attached patch attempts to partially replace the (very old) version of
the DocumentTemplate package once imported from Zope by a never version,
in an attempt to make QMTest compatible with python 2.5.

This version mainly replaces all uses of the 'regex' module by 're' (which,
unfortunately is not trivial due to some subtle differences between the two,
but it also contains some other small changes (e.g. replaces deprecated
calls such as atoi() by int()).

When using python 2.5, a warning about the (now deprecated) 'with' token
is issued (as that apparently will become a keyword in 2.6), so I'm looking
into replacing that, or merging more changes from a current Zope version
in, depending on which is easier.

Thanks,
		Stefan

On ubuntu dapper,

$ apt-file search /Python.h

shows a bunch of things, but what matters is:

python2.2-dev: usr/include/python2.2/Python.h
python2.3-dev: usr/include/python2.3/Python.h
python2.4-dev: usr/include/python2.4/Python.h

Simply installing "python-dev" will get the right one for the default
python.  (either with synaptic, or just "sudo aptitude install python-dev")

Thank you Mark and Stefan for the prompt response.

I have python 2.4, but didn't realize I didn't have python-dev as well.
I have since downloaded qmtest with synaptic, and it is working fine.

Will keep you posted if I have further problems.

Thanks again.

Hi,

Your tool looks very interesting. Thank you for making it open source.

While trying out the tool, I find that the command 'qmtest create' does
not have an option to provide a name for the new test. The only option
available is '-o' which does not seem to add anything to the qmtest data
base.

Appreciate your help.
Thanks and Regards,
Abhijit

'qmtest create --id my_test test ...' should be what you want. It creates
a new test named 'my_test', stored in the file 'my_test.qmt'.

I just realized that the --id option was added right after the last (2.3)
release. Can you use a snapshot from the repository ?

I clearly need to work on a new release. :-)

I do not have subversion to be able to download the same.
Is there any other way I can access the source.
