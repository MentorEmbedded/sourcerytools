Hi,

I wanted to know how to turn on the logs of Qmtest while its running and 
where is the log file being formed.

Thanks

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'logs'. What information are
you looking for ?

Subject: partial order on prereqs independent of outcome?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0604061107280.6264@cag.csail.mit.edu>


Dear QMTest Gurus,

I have a situation where I am running a test suite using multiple targets
on the same physical machine (a 4-process target on a machine with 2 
multi-threaded cpus).

A few tests come relatively close to operating-system limits on some 
system resources.  Resulting in onpredictable failures if multiple such 
tests run simultaneously.

I would like to assure multiple "resource-hog" tests do not run at the 
same time.

I think that the simplest way to do this would be to establish a linear 
order between resource-hog tests.  The mechanism of using prerequisites
almost works, except -- to quote the manual:

"A test specifies for each of its prerequisite tests an expected outcome. 
If the prerequisite is included in the test run and the actual outcome of 
the prerequisite test is different from the expected outcome, the test is 
not run. Instead, it is given an UNTESTED outcome."

In my situation I want ignore the outcome of a test, and merely have the 
fact that it has been run be a prerequisite for running another test.

A quick skim through the code makes me believe that the question of what 
to patch or subclass is NOT "intuitively obvious to the most casual 
observer", since and get this info threaded through the infrastructure from 
XMLDatabase.__ParseTestDocument to ExecutionEngine. __FindRunnableTest
My idea here being: use an expected outcome of "*" for a prerequisite to 
indicate that any expected outome is acceptable

Before going further on my own, I though I would ask the experts:

(1) What do I need to subclass or patch to make the running of a test a 
prerequisite if another test independent of the outcome of the first test.

(2) Is this requirement encountered often enought that it should be 
considered for inclusion in future releases?

Thanks,

I don't think it is a good idea to try to use prerequisite tests for
scheduling. Parallelism is what targets are meant to address.

I haven't seen such a requirement before, and I'm not sure what to propose.
While I understand the problem you are trying to solve I don't think that
such a feature fits well into QMTest concepts. QMTest simply doesn't have
any way to express can-run-in-parallel and can-not-run-in-parallel properties.
It would be much easier to reduce the overal concurrency of your test runs,
though that obviously means longer build cycles.

Thanks,
		Stefan

I understand that there should be other ways of dealing with parallel vs 
not in parallel.  I had thought that there might have been some call 
before for multiple allowable outcomes on a pre-req.  For instance "ERROR 
or FAIL".  If that feature existed, I could build on it.

I can't decrease the parallelism from 4 to 1 since that would increase the 
test time from 6 to 24 hours per cycle.

The obvious solution is to throw independent hardware at the problem.
I can't see how to use ssh from a batch process to get access to multiple 
systems without exposing my passphrase or my password.  Using a background 
interactive process where I run ssh-agent is vulnerable to the occasional 
system reboot.

One of these days, when not fighting fires, I will put a 
PBS back end on to solve this problem.  PBS's idea of distributed batch 
processing is a poor match for QMTest's idea of being in control of the
order of processing, but if I run QMTest with more threads than the number 
of simultaneous processes that PBS will allow me to run, then I should be 
able to jury-rig something.  It's just that I have been trying for the 
last several months to find a bit of free time to do this and there has 
always been a higher-priority task that needs doing -- I'm sure that you 
know the situation.

Subject: Variable in argument list
Message-ID: <443ACE5E.3020902@fastmail.fm>

I'm trying to set up qmtest so that from the command line I can specify 
a specific host to run all of my tests against. In other words, I have 
about 12 hosts, and I only want QMTest to run against the host I specify 
in the command line.

What is the best way to configure this? I used to specify this in the 
argument list, and have a different suite for each hostname, but as my 
testbed increased in size, this is becoming unmanageable, and I know 
what to specify the host as a dynamic argument. What is the best way to 
configure this in QMTest? It looks like the Argument List expects a 
string, and not another variable.

Actually, it looks like the context switch may do it. So, if I run 
qmtest like this:

qmtest run -c SUT=blade testsuite.test1

how would I specify this context variable inside of a test? Could I 
simply place SUT in the field argument list?

I believe that should be possible by setting up a target file:

http://www.codesourcery.com/public/qmtest/qm-snapshot/qm/test/doc/html/sec-qmtest-concepts.html#sec-targets

and then use that with the 'qmtest run' command.
I'm not sure what you are referring to as 'argument list' here. Arguments
to what command ?

Thanks,

The context dictionary is provided in the Test.Run() call, so you
can use its values there. However, that requires that your test
classes do all the work of connecting to the host that should run
the actual test. Wouldn't it be simpler to use QMTest's builtin
support for this (see my other mail) ?

Ok, in this case a context variable seems indeed like the best way to
go. Run 'qmtest run -c name=variable' and from your test's Run() method
access the variable as 'context["name"]'.

Thanks. But if I'm not writing my own classes, etc, I just want to

That's correct. QMTest also supports a 'Host' extension type that supports
remote program execution by means of 'rsh' or 'ssh' without any need to
prepare that machine, as that extension is responsible for uploading files
before executing them remotely.
(You can provide your own 'Host' types in the same way you can implement
your own tests, and so have full control over what to upload and where.)

I see ! While you may be able to use these fields, you usually shouldn't
use different values for the same test in different test runs. To quote
from the manual:

"The arguments to the test parameterize the test; they are what make two
  instances of the same test class different from each other."

Ok, I tried to use the targets file, and I'm getting all kinds of python

1) Installed qmtest on the remote machine I want to test
2) removed the ssh -qX $1 out of my test case
3) removed the argument list from my testcase
4) created a target file that looks like this: <hostname> 
rsh_target.RSHTarget xw4000 remote_shell="/usr/bin/ssh"
5) ran qmtest with following: qmtest run -T <targetfile> <testcasename>

and I get the following output:

Any ideas why this would fail? I can run the testcase if I first ssh to

I don't quite understand the question. There is a one-to-one mapping
between extension (e.g. Test) parameters and those variables in the
xml files (you can think of these xml files as a serialized form of
the test). The meaning is defined by the Test class. If you want to
add a new variable, or change the meaning of an existing variable,
this indicates that you probably want to write your own test class(es).

It seems the errors stems from qmtest trying to parse the target file
(which should contain an xml document). It may be simpler to create
that target file by means of the 'qmtest create-target' command, at least
to get an initial version that contains the right syntax. You could
then make manual adjustments (such as changing hostname etc.).

Ah, that was my problem, it needed to be in xml format. That worked 
great! So I'll adopt this solution to my tests and all should be well!

I recently moved my test suite for another platform, which is code named 
Breezy, the Ubuntu Linux release.

I've previously been running my testsuite using QMTest on RedHat and 
Ubuntu Hoary. However, I was amazed to see that when I ran some negative 
tests, such as attempting to create a file or directory where I don't 
have permissions. On Redhat and Ubuntu Hoary [kernel 2.4x], I would 
always get non zero exit codes on such tests. However, now I'm getting 
exit codes of 0. I don't understand what happened. Code the version of 
python I'm using affect this? Here's an example of a test:

A simple script that tries to touch a file in a directory where it does 
not have write permissions:

touch /home/user/testfile

If I try the same test from a shell script, and echo the exit code, it 
is non zero.

I'm kind of baffled!

I have seen situations in which a non-zero exit code of a command was not
correctly reported back, though I don't remember whether that was a bug
in the script or a problem with a particular shell.
However, I fear I don't have enough details to be able to make meaningful
suggestions. Are you sure you use the same version of QMTest in both cases ?
What about the test class ? Is it any of QMTest's builtin classes ? If not,
could you post some code ? (Especially the one that evaluates the exit code.)
What does your command look like ?

Well, here's an exmple of a test that fails on Breezy, kernel 2.6.16.1, 
and the same exact test that passes on Redhat [kernel 2.4x] and Hoary, 
kernel 2.6.13.4:

My test is a shell script, and the shell script is simply:

touch <pathname>

The pathname is a place where the user running the test does not have 
permissions. On Redhat and Hoary, I get the correct exit Code from 
QMTest, which is 1. I'm using QMTest's built in checks for exit codes. I 
do get the expected standard error in all cases, which is:

touch: cannot touch <pathname>:  Permission denied

The system where the wrong exit code is returned is running Python 
2.4.2. The other two systems where the exit code is correct, are 
running: Python 2.4.1 and Python 2.2.2.
