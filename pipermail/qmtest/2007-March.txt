Subject: qmtest and Python 2.3.5 on Windows XP
Message-ID: <45F154D5.9000302@isogmbh.de>

When trying to run qmtest for the first time, I get the following error:

E:\Python23\Scripts>qmtest.py run
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "E:\Python23\Scripts\qmtest.py", line 130, in ?
import qm.test.cmdline
File "E:\Python23\Lib\site-packages\qm\test\cmdline.py", line 20, in ?
import base
File "E:\Python23\Lib\site-packages\qm\test\base.py", line 391, in ?
import qm.host
File "E:\Python23\Lib\site-packages\qm\host.py", line 18, in ?
from qm.executable import RedirectedExecutable
File "E:\Python23\Lib\site-packages\qm\executable.py", line 29, in ?
import pywintypes
ImportError: No module named pywintypes

Is this the same error as this one?
Bug in RedirectedExecutable.Spawn on Windows (QMTest 2.3)

Can you help?
Sincelerey,
Thomas Schwemlein

I believe you are missing the pywin32 extensions that are required to
run QMTest on windows (native). You will find them here:

Hi All,



I'm trying to download the current QMTest source code from the SVN repository (svn://source.codesourcery.com), but I always get a "svn: Connection closed unexpectedly" message. The connections with other SVN servers are working fine. So, the problem seems to be really on svn://source.codesourcery.com.



Do you guys have some information about this? There is any alternative way to get the current QMTest source code?



Thanks,

Edisson

Subject: "[Errno 3] No such process" problem on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <20070330154005.21068.qmail@web53804.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi,

We're trying to work with QMTest, but we are getting some problems to have it running on Ubuntu machines.

The problem we have is similar to the ones reported in http://www.codesourcery.com/archives/qmtest/msg01223.html and http://www.codesourcery.com/archives/qmtest/msg01196.html. In some situations, like running a shell command test on the GUI or just calling "python setup.py check", QMTest returns an exception "[Errno 3] No such process".

I got this problem on Ubuntu Edgy (6.10), which is the current stable version. I also tried on Ubuntu Feisty (7.04), which is currently in a beta version, but I also got the same problem. 

I also tried on an older Ubuntu version - Ubuntu Dapper (6.06) -  and it worked fine.

So, do you guys have some new information about this? There is some way to have it running on the current Ubuntu versions? Since this problem was also seen in other distributions, there is some solution for this problem on the QMTest side?

BTW, I followed the workaround suggested by Stefan in a previous e-mail (catch and ignore that particular exception thrown by os.setpgid() ) and I didn't get the "[Errno 3] No such process" anymore. However, when I run "python setup.py check" sometimes the test freezes at the beginning of the tests during the execution of "xmldb.signals_unblocked". When it doesn't freeze on this point, it will freeze during the SSH test. If I interrupt the execution at this point, the Traceback will show this:

qmtest: Interrupted.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/edisson/src/qmsrc/qm-svn/build/scripts-2.4/qmtest", line 132, in ?

I'm using python2.4.

I would appreciate to have some help on this subject!

Thanks in advance,
Edisson Braga Jr.

Subject: QMTest plans
Message-ID: <20070330204316.74691.qmail@web63511.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

Hello everybody,



Does QMTest already support python2.5? If not, there are any plans to do this migration? I'm running Ubuntu feisty (7.04) and got errors related (I guess) to ExceptionTest class in qm/test/classes/python.py . Maybe the reason is the differences between the traceback format on python2.4 and python2.5, as you can see in the example below:


-- Traceback example on Python 2.4 --
Python 2.4.4 (#2, Mar 29 2007, 12:00:57)

[GCC 4.1.2 (Ubuntu 4.1.2-0ubuntu4)] on linux2

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> import qm.cmdline

>>> option_d = ('d', 'd_option', None, 'Option D Description')

>>> option_e = ('e', 'd_option', None, 'Option E Description')

>>> command_1 = ('create', 'Create an issue', 'name',

...              "This command will create an issue. _name_ is the"

...              " name of the issue to be created.",

...              [option_d, option_e])

>>> qm.cmdline.CommandParser('qmtrack', [], [command_1])

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?

  File "qm/cmdline.py", line 128, in __init__

    raise ValueError, \

ValueError: duplicate long command option --d_option

>>>

>>>




I'd like to contribute to qmtest and I think that the better way to start would be with small changes. Would you like to receive patches changing the code to use some PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)? My suggestions are the pep-0008[0], pep-0257[1], pep-0290[2]. And how about changing modules to use subprocess[3] as a command executer, and other similar changes?


BTW, any plans to release a new version? When?
