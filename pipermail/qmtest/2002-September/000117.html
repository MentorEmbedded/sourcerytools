<PRE>Summary: I've attached a patch file for qmtest-1.1.5 that adds the 
ability to run qmtest as a service on RH 7.3. This means you can have
the qmtest gui come up when the machine boots and you can 
start/stop/reload/status with /sbin/service.

The patch adds a new switch to 'qmtest gui', namely --pidfile 
&lt;pathname&gt;. This pathname indicates where to put the pid for the
http (zope) process. The default is /var/run/qmtest.pid. As currently
implemented, a pidfile is always written out on startup, but you might
want it to be optional. It seemed to make sense that it was available.

I created a 'contrib' directory and put the service start up script
qmtest.in there. Configure creates the service startup script qmtest 
from it. There's an associated qmtest.conf file for the service startup
script if you don't like its defaults. I did NOT modify 'make install' 
to install these scripts. They're RedHat specific. Also should they be
moved to ${prefix}/sbin or /etc/rc.d/init.d, where RedHat expects them?

I modified configure.in to generate contrib/qmtest from contrib/qmtest.in.

I modified GNUmakefile.in by adding two new targets: 'tags', to make an
emacs tags file (TAGS) and 'diff' to assist in making patch files.
The diff target needs some work. You'll see why below.

The patch file modifies: configure.in, GNUmakefile.in, 
qm/test/cmdline.py and qm/platform_unix.py. It adds the directory
contrib and files contrib/qmtest.in, contrib/qmtest.conf. Other
cruft has crept in, including qm/build. I'm not sure what qm/build
does, but I'm sure its generated and I didn't fool with the patch file.

It would be nice if there was a README.contributor that tutored the
newbie (me) in how to add to qmtest. In particular, I've been going
through the fairly slow cycle of:

         ... change something ...
         $ autoconf  # when changing configure.in
         $ ./configure
         $ make
         $ make check
         $ make install
         ... test my changes here ...

I believe it would be possible, and far more expedient, to be able to 
run qmtest &quot;in place&quot; where I'm editing the sources so that I can 
immediately see the effects of my changes. But I don't know how to
do this. A better 'make diff' would also help feed changes back in.
For example, 'make install' compiles files and moves them to ${prefix}
and its subdirectories. But when I'm developing, I don't need to move
files around, right?

I did a lot of work for not many code changes in the end. Some of this 
is learning curve, but others will have similar learning curves. 
Shouldn't we lessen the slope of the curve, if we can? I'll volunteer to 
help with this, but others might be more capable and better suited.
In particular, it it would be nice if test classes (qm/test/classes)
could be aggregated and reused.

If these adds are considered appropriate, I'd like them to be folded 
into the main trunk so that I don't have to add them with each new
snapshot. Please send me some email on what you decide. Thanks.
