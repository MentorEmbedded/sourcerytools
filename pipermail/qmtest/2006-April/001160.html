I don't think it is a good idea to try to use prerequisite tests for
scheduling. Parallelism is what targets are meant to address.

</I>
I haven't seen such a requirement before, and I'm not sure what to propose.
While I understand the problem you are trying to solve I don't think that
such a feature fits well into QMTest concepts. QMTest simply doesn't have
any way to express can-run-in-parallel and can-not-run-in-parallel properties.
It would be much easier to reduce the overal concurrency of your test runs,
though that obviously means longer build cycles.

Thanks,
		Stefan
