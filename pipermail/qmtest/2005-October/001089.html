<PRE>
Highest level:
   I would like to create a target for running QMTest tests under openPBS.
If anyone just happens to have created such a thing already and is willing 
to share it, I would be grateful.
   I inherited a test harness that mostly hides QMTest, but uses it for 
running a regression test suite sequentially.  The suite has grown large 
enough that I want to parallelize its execution.  To get access to 
multiple machines I will need to use openPBS, so will need to extend a 
target method.

So far:
   I started out just playing around under QMtest 2.0.3 with some of the 
parallel targets (multiple threads, multiple processes) and found that 
they did not work: occasional ERROR 13 when using multiple processes, 
occasional incorrect output using multiple threads, neither of which 
occurs with sequential execution.
   So I thought to upgrade to QMTest 2.3 to get the last two+ years of bug 
fixes.

Unfortunately:
   The extensions to qm.test.test.Test that I had inherited depended on 
code that was removed between 2.0.3 and 2.3:  the chdir to the directory 
containing the individual test.  I haven't been able to track through the 
QMTest 2.0.3 code thoroughly yet, but it seems that it must be the chdir 
that has been removed from the qm.test.database.ItemDescriptor __Execute method.

Considering that I am new to both Python and QMtest extension, I would be 
grateful for any pointers as to where to grab the test directory so as to 
update test extension code to do the chdir itself:  I hope that I can get
this information through the context.  However, the manual in section 4.3
has a bad link to internal documentation on context -- which provoked 
enough frustration that I decided to send out this message before 
instumenting my code to dump out context and see if the test directory can 
be found...
