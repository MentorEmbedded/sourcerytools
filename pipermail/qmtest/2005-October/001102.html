Red Hat 9.0 has 2.2, which is where I ran into the issue.  I have also
occasionally run into things where I needed to something different for
python 2.2, after I check in, since most of the systems that I use have
2.3 or later and I would miss something locally and get caught later. 
It is getting harder to keep track of these little things.

You are probably probably right.  Many of the newer features are nice
(I find the &quot;What's New in Python 2.x&quot; pages on python.org very
useful), but I have not had a compelling case yet where something
trumped compatibility.  Bound to happen one of these days soon, I think.
