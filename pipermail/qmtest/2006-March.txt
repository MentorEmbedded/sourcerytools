Subject: Working Directory changed?
Message-ID: <3D555FEB05BE7E4783098DDF56F5AEC701EC4658@sestoex01.enea.se>

Hi,

I've upgraded qmtest from 2.0.3 to 2.3.0, and am experiencing a problem.

Before the working directory in qmtest (at least within a test class) was the directory where the qmt test file resided. Now it seems to be the qmtest DB root directory or is it the working directory when qmtest was invoked?

Is there any easy way of changing this back? (some tests don't work any more, they reference files relative to the qmt test file).

Regards,
Ted H?rnstedt

The chdir was unsafe in the presence of parallel test runs, i.e.,
"qmtest run -j N", because a process may only have a single "current
directory", even if it has multiple threads.

The context variable "qmtest.dbpath" contains the root of the database.
 So, you can have your individual tests change to that directory (if
they run in a separate process), or use that variable to create
filenames that will work (if your tests run as part of QMTest itself).

That's really strange.  Are you sure it's turning into LF/CR and not
just the UNIX LF convention?  I can't think of anything that would
mangle it in the way that you suggest.

Mark,

I've encountered this issue in another place in my test class. My
previous description  of the issue above is incorrect: the source file
has Windows-style line endings (\r\n), and when they get copied to the
attachment store, they end up with an extra carriage return in the line
ending (\r\r\n). 

Normally this wouldn't be a problem except for a couple of specifics to
my test setup. Some of the copied files are PHP test scripts that get
copied to a server under test: PHP chokes on the modified files. Also,
when I try to use an attachment file as a baseline to compare to a test
result, the comparison fails. I'm opening the attachment in Python using
the flags "rb", because sometimes the expected result is text, and
sometimes it is binary.

On the text front, I've tried using the Python string "splitlines()"
function to disregard line endings, but it creates extra elements in the
resulting list for each "\r".

I'm planning on working around this problem a couple of ways: I'm now
copying the PHP files without using the attachment store, and I'm
thinking of splitting my baseline comparison so text baselines are
opened using only the "r" flag and binaries are opened using the "rb" as
before.

Some more information that may be pertinent: QMTest is being run on
Windows XP SP2 using ActivePython 2.4.2.

Despite the fact that I'm thinking of working around this issue, I'd
still like to know what, if anything, I'm doing wrong.

Thanks in advance for any guidance you can offer.

Cheers,
Ken Horovatin

Subject: Another Attachment Field question
Message-ID: <A38E2B73AFE64542931B589AAD9644EF013E8035@msgusawmb03.ads.autodesk.com>

I'm having an odd (to me) problem using the AttachmentField in a test
class I've written.
 
My test class is derived from a base class that is derived from the
QMTest Test class. Both my base test class and the test class in
question contain a number of fields, including boolean, text, set and
enumeration fields..
 
The problem is this: the AttachmentField is an optional field, but if I
use the gui to try and create a new test case using my test class, as I
populate any of the set fields, the attachment field displays with a
light red background and displays an "unpack non-sequence" error
message, and I am unable to save the test case.
 
As a very temporary workaround, I'm attaching a dummy file, but this is
obviously not the optimal solution.
 
Any ideas?
 
Cheers,
Ken Horovatin

Subject: Questions about sql_result_stream
Message-ID: <BAY109-F20EA9090DA829CABF1AE279EDB0@phx.gbl>

Hi,
I?m implementing a database framework for storing results from qmtest.
I have looked at qm/test/classes/sql_result_stream.py in the CVS version,
but I?m not sure how to use it.

What I want to be able to do is to do my testing first, and then,
by pointing out the results.qmr file, extract the actual results, and store
it in a database. Is sql_result_stream a good example of this, and
do I activate/use this extensions.

regards,
Claes

All result streams are used with 'qmtest run' calls, i.e. qmtest will insert
results during execution (see 'qmtest run --help' as well as the manual for
details).
It should certainly be possible to write a script that opens a results file,
and then transfers individual results into a different results stream (such
as SQLResultStream).

Regards,
		Stefan

You can also convert results from one format to another using "qmtest
summarize".  I believe something like:

  qmtest summarize --result-stream=SQLResultStream results.qmr

will do that, although I forget the exact command-line syntax.

That definitely sounds like a bug.  Care to work on a patch? :-)

I've attached a patch file that corrects an issue that has annoyed us
for a while: when using the gui on Windows (either IE or Firefox), the
window that opens up with the attachment upload form is too small for
the form.

This patch is a one-liner that increases the window size just enough to
allow all the controls to be visible. I've not tested it on other
platforms, but it should be safe.
