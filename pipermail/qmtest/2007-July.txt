Sanjoy,

please send any QMTest-related questions to the QMTest mailing list.

What test database are you using ? The XML database, which is used by
default, stores test instances in (XML) config files. Part of that
configuration is the set of arguments with which to instantiate the test
class.
The 'ExecTest.arguments' parameter is part of that set.
In other words, what you want is already possible, if I understand you correctly.

Regards,

Hi QMTest folks, and hi Stefan -- we've met on the SCons list; I've been
impressed with the QMTest setup for testing scons and now I want to use it for
my own software.

I installed qmtest 2.3 on my Windows XP system with Python 2.4 (regular
python, not cygwin).  I'm starting on the tutorial, but I get errors right away:

% pwd
c:\tmp
% mkdir tdb
% cd tdb
% qmtest create-tdb
QMTest has created a new test database at 'c:\tmp\tdb\.'.
% qmtest create --id=python_pass -a expression='True' test python.ExecTest
qmtest: error: create: option --id not recognized

Run 'qmtest --help' to get instructions about how to use QMTest.
%

Did I install it incorrectly?  Why doesn't it accept the --id option as in the
tutorial?  If I don't use the --id option, it runs but it only puts out an XML
document on stdout.

This is due to me publishing an online tutorial that doesn't correspond to the
last official release, but instead the current version from the repository.
I'm sorry for the confusion. (I'll try hard to wrap up all the current work to
get ready for another release.)

Meanwhile, you can use the '--output' option instead. Noting that with the XMLDatabase
there is a 1-1 correspondence between test file (.qmt) names and test ids, you can
write the above command as

qmtest create --output=python_pass.qmt -a expression='True' test python.ExecTest

having the exact same effect.

Let me know what your current expectations are, i.e. what features you are
particularly interested in. Depending on that you may continue using the 2.3
release, or try a current snapshot instead.

Thanks for your interest !

		Stefan

A resource is a device to prepare the environment tests that depend
on it will be run in.
By definition / construction, this environment is meant to be shared
by all dependent tests. Thus, a resource is always ever set up once (per target),
and not once per test. If you really want to do it for each test, why
use a resource at all ?

Regards,
		Stefan

Hi Stefan ,QMTest folks :

I am facing a critical problem in the handling of resources by QMTest
The scenario is the follow : 

T1 (test1) contains R1 (resource1)
T2 (test2) contains R2 (resource2) 
T3 (test3) contains R3 (resource1)

All of them are contained in one  suit 

When I run the suit the behavior is :

A)SetUp R1 and Run T1
B)SetUP R2 and Run T2 
C)Run T3 Without SetUp R1 .

The question is how  can I make in order to SetUp  R1 in step c) before
running of T3.
Which are the lines of codes that I have to insert in my code to solve
this problem .

Thanks in advance .

Hi -- thanks for the info, and sorry for the delay in replying!  Turns out I
wasn't subscribed, and missed your response until I stumbled over it in the
archives... totally my fault :-(

What I'm hoping for is to use QMTest just like SCons does for testing cmd line
programs, basing success/failure on exit status and stdout/err.  I expect to
have some things like QMTest/TestCmd.py, QMTest/TestCommon.py, and so on (just
like SCons).  Then I want to put a bunch of test-foo.py files into a dir, and
have "qmtest run" run them!

As for the tutorial, I used your change above, and that works.  But then the
next command 'qmtest ls' also fails.  But "qmtest gui" works!  Very nice!
Also qmtest run now works.  I notice that creating a test as above only
creates a .qmt file in the current dir; it doesn't change anything in the
QMTest subdir.  Is that expected?

So if I wanted to use TestCmd.py (and/or TestCommon.py) from SCons, and define
a test based on it so I could add my test_foo.py files, what would my next
steps be?  Sorry to be such a newbie on this.

Thanks!

Subject: Add to PYTHONPATH for tests?
Message-ID: <46AA5DE5.4040309@genarts.com>

I'm subclassing Test, and I'd like to execute some python tests via the shell.
 However I need them to have the QMTest dir in their PYTHONPATH.  Is there a
QMtest-approved way to tweak PYTHONPATH, or should I just do this:

class Test(test.Test):
    """Simple test that runs a python script and checks the status
    to determine whether the test passes."""

...
    def Run(self, context, result):
        """Run the test"

        env = os.environ.copy()
        env['PYTHONPATH'] = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'QMTest')
        args = [context.get('python', sys.executable), self.script]
        command = RedirectedExecutable()
        status = command.Run(args, env)
        ...

Any hints?

There's nothing built-in to do that, so your approach looks good.
