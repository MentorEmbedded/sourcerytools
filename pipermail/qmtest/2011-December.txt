Subject: [qmtest] QMTest has a new home
Message-ID: <4EF4CDBA.60504@codesourcery.com>

Hello everyone,

in an effort to grow the QMTest user- and developer- community, we have
moved QMTest to a new home at github.com. You can find us at
http://qmtest.github.com/qmtest/. I hope to meet you there !

We are working on some cleanup (especially portability issues with newer
Python versions), and are aiming for a new (minor) release sometime
early next year.

Meanwhile, I wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

    Stefan
