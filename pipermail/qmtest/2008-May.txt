I have the same issue. 
All the tests which roughly take more than 60 sec are timeout. Even
though the test completed and I can see the result by going back in
internet explorer. 

Jeff, did you find the solution for it?
Please let me know. 

Thanks
Pankaj

I really wish I could find the Search feature in the list archives!  It
might have saved me posting this question if it has already been
answered.

I am running QMTest 2.4 on Windows XP SP2.  I have a large number of
tests that I would like to run with the QMTest GUI, but when I do, the
results page times out.  I can run subgroups of these tests with no
problem, but not the entire suite.

Is there some way of changing the default timeout value for the browser?
I usually use Mozilla Firefox, but Internet Explorer 7 is also available
to me.

If anyone has any ideas about how to solve this problem, I would be glad
to know about it.

Thanks!
 
Jeff Jones

Pankaj,

The only answer I came up with was to run the suite of tests with a
script, then open the results file in the browser.

However, Pavel Cisar with IBPhoenix sent me this reply, and what he
describes works for me as well.

I hope this helps!
