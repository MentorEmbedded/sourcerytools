<PRE>Hi,

QMTest today assumes that the idle state of a target is an QMTest 
internal state, i.e. whenever it is idle or not only depends on the 
tests scheduled to it by the execution engine. However we have embedded 
targets that we intend to share among many user who all can run QMTest 
therefor when someone starts QMTest some targets may be occupied by 
somebody else, this can be detected by our target class implementation, 
which reserves the target, but there is no way to let the execution 
engine know about that, i.e. the target idle state is actually external 
to QMTest.

I would like to implement an API to QMTest (and submit that as a patch) 
that does one of two things:
(1) Asynchronously notifies the execution engine that the idle state of 
the target has changed.
(2) Dynamically add a new target.

The alternative (1) would be my first choice. Typically when the target 
is started it would check whenever it is already allocated and in that 
case notify the execution engine that the idle state has changed (since 
QMTest assumes that all targets are idle from the beginning) then the 
execution engine would call target.IsIdle() to update its state. Our 
target class has its own thread that can detect when the state change again.

What are your thoughts about this?

Regards,
Sven Lundblad
