&gt;<i> that.  And, a selection box with 15,000 entries turns out not to work
</I>&gt;<i> very well. :-)
</I>
Yeah, it occurred to me after sending it that it was probably a
scaling issue; it does (1) increase the learning curve (2)
discourages verbose resource names.  (if it were an application, I'd
say &quot;Ok, then I want completion&quot; :-)

I'm also not sure that I'd want to work with the gui at all once I had
15k resources (as it is I'm keeping the test database under CVS, but I
haven't tried generating any of the xml from scripts - yet; I
certainly plan to at some point, since we have matrix tests...)

&gt;<i> What we really want is a hierarchical selector gizmo.  We'll get there...
</I>
Yeah, you're right :-) that would encourage hierarchical organization
of tests, which is an even better thing.  (I'm fond of the design
principle that right things should be easy to express, and &quot;wrong&quot;
things should take more work... oddly enough, Ada95 demonstrates this
-- at least when compared to C or C++, which support the reverse.)

&gt;<i> We decided that Netscape 4 was dead.  Perhaps reports of its death have
</I>&gt;<i> been greatly exaggerated.  We're trying to move towards XHTML/DOM, and
</I>
I'd certainly like to treat it as dead - I'd only tried it at all
because it was what came up by default with 1.1.3, and was testing to
make sure it wasn't a galeon issue.
