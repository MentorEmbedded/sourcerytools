<PRE>First: as someone who worked with dejagnu for years (Cygnus employee
#16 or so :-) I'm very happy to see something real in this space.
I've been encouraging my coworkers to read the qmtest manual just
because you got the *definitions* right, and have the clearest
expression of the problem that I've yet seen...

Next: Has anyone worked out tweaks to run the user interface without
javascript?  (well, really, &quot;with lynx or w3m&quot; -- I'm interested both
for remote use on my part [ssh lynx is easier to set up than adhoc
tunnels], and because a friend and fellow developer of mine is blind.)
It *looks* like it's just &quot;add explicit go-buttons to the menus&quot;,
might make it a little uglier [so it should be an optional profile or
something], I just wondered if anyone else has made a start at it yet.
(It's already clear that using stunnel to point to a qmtest gui on a
fixed port will be a great way to do remote test management...)

Finally: I've got half a million years of perl experience (yes, I have
code written in perl *3* that still works with minor tweaks :-) but
I'm just starting to pick up python.  I need to build some Resource
classes, and started with a copy of classes/temporary.py to build a
MirrorResource that takes a &quot;url&quot; argument and calls wget -m on it to
mirror it into a temporary directory (so that the &quot;real&quot; test can just
declare a dependency on a resource-instance which is a mirror of a
specific url-tree.)  The problem I'm having is that qmtest conceals
some errors in resource class execution... or at least I can't find
where they go.  I'm doing separate syntax checking of the module,
classes.qmc is fine, the gui sees the class and lets me create a
resource from it, but at run time all I get is &quot;Setup of a required
resource failed.&quot;  So: where do I look, or how do I trace (strace
wasn't informative enough) or testbench my Resource classes?
