Subject: OS shell dependencies?

I'm new to qmtest.  And trying to work through the 
tutorial.  Everything is fine until I need to use (...) or "..." on 
the command line (section 1.6 and further of the tutorial).

I thought it might be a shell issue, but I've tried a couple of them: 
bash, tcsh, zsh.  Each shell behaves a little different, but all 
basically won't accept the command line.  I have literally 
cut-and-paste from the tutorial.  Here's some examples.  The error 
message is just before the final prompt in each example.  And I added 
a blank line between each prompt just to make reading a little easier.

tcsh:

[melkin at lab-linux64 sc-test]$ qmtest 
--version

Well, I've figured most of it out.  Partly it is a quirk of the Z shell command line.  And partly it is because I did LITERALLY cut-paste from the qmtest tutorial.

In the tutorial, the command line is:

qmtest create --id compile test compilation_test.CompilationTest(executable="compile", source_files="['/path/to/compile.cc']")"

The problem turns out to be a missing double-quote symbol as well as mixing up single and double quotes.  I found that the following is the correct syntax for both BASH and TCSH:

qmtest create --id compile test "compilation_test.CompilationTest(executable='compile', source_files='["/path/to/compile.cc"]')"

Since this works for both BASH and TCSH, I'm just going to withdraw the ZSH comment.  (I'm not a ZSH fan anyway, but it is what the sysadmins like.)


Mark
