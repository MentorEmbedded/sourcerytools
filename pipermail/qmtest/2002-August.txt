Subject: Prerequisite tests problems
Message-ID: <E17aEws-0004zc-00@zigzag.lvk.cs.msu.su>


Hello,
I've trying to specify a test called "history.empty_main" as prerequisite for 
"time.empty_main" and cannot. The list of possible to in prerequisite adding 
dialog includes only time* tests and when I try "history.empty_main" 
manually, it results in message

    KeyError: history.empty_main

in the console, and test is simply not run -- without no messages in the gui.

Is is possible to specify prerequisite tests from different directory, and 
how?

That is definitely a bug.

I've done a little research on this, and it looks like this was an
intentional design choice.  The idea was that if you could choose as
a prerequisite a test from outside the current directory tree, then
it would be hard to move directories around -- you might move the
directory and lose a prerequisite.

I'm not sure how compelling of a reason that is.  What do you think?

I'm not compelled yet. You see, in my case the two tests "belong" to 
top-level --- moving "history.empty-main" under "time.*" would not be right. 
IOW, the fact that  "time.empty-main" depends on "history.empty-main" doesn't 
mean that "history.empty-main" has anything to do with time. 

As for moving directories around.... you can decide to move some second level 
directory to top-level and lose a prerequisite in that case. In general, I 
think moving directories is not that frequent operation, and some 
incovenience is ok.

I think I just fixed this bug.  Please apply the appended patch to
your copy of xmldb.py (in /usr/local/lib/qm/qm/test, if you installed
QMTest in the default location) and try again.  You may need to run
compileall.py on that directory after applying the patch.

> What are attributes actually used for?

Some of them are for communication between internal objects.  Others
are just for the user's benefit.

QMTest runs as you, if you invoked it.

That's very weird output.  Are you sure you invoked QMTest as carifio?

Is there a way to make "qmtest run" operate nonrecursively?
I.e. I want it to execute all tests in "time" directory but not in any 
subdirectories of "time".

No, there's no way to do that.

It might be a good idea to add something along these lines, but I'm not
sure quite what.

To some extent, this indicates that you're not using subdirectories as
they were intended, I suppose...

Hi,

We're in the process to extend QMtest to support QA for Firebird project 
(a fork of Borland InterBase SQL server). Due to specific needs of tests 
and resources for database engine, we'd like define dependencies not just 
for tests, but also for resources (a resource depends on another 
resource). Is this feature planned for "near" versions of QMTest, or are 
we on our own to implement this feature ?

Thanks for any info

Hmm... maybe just "--nonrecursive" comand line option, with an obvious(?) 
semantics?

Can't agree. Originally there were no directories under "time", only tests. 
Later, some directories were added with many tests. But still I want to run 
tests in "test" only, just to catch bugs early without waiting for a long 
time. Those tests can be seen as "minimal" testsuite. 

You can argue that if I constantly want to bypass a set of tests then the 
tests are poorly designed, but ...  if I'm sure that 10% of tests will catch 
most blunders I make, I'd prefer to run all tests only before comitting.

Maybe.  But then you can't run some directories recursively and some
non-recursively on the same command-line.

One way to do that is to create a test suite.  That's the idea behind
a testsuite -- a set of tests that you want to run as a group on a
regular basis.

It's a good idea.  I've added it to our TODO list, but it probably won't
happen right away.

Note that we are happy to provide enhancements to QMTest on a contract
basis, should you be interested in that.

Yep, I know. But Firebird is an open source project too :-) We have more

classes to Target. For each target there is a couple of different setup
procedures that needs to be done to create an environment there the
tests can execute. These are specific for each target group but several
tests and resources can run on different target groups. What I would
like is for a resource to get the object reference for the target it is
executing on so that it can initiate its resource for that particular
target. However I do not find a way for a resource to get hold of the
target that it is running on in an easy way, any suggestions?

Yea. But I'd say that case is more rare.

I feel that if there's directory<->implicit testsuite mapping, then 
nonrecursive behaviours is an natural thing. It's a personal opinion of 
course and I'd like to hear other's opinions.
(Actually, I'd like to see all such issues in a tracker, but guess QMTrack is 
not going to be ready soon?)

Subject: remote testing question
Message-ID: <000401c243b9$355c5710$196fa8c0@usys.com>

According to
http://www.codesourcery.com/qm/qmtest_downloads/qm-1.1.5/manual.html/sec
-ref-targets.html#sec-target-classes
in section 3.6.3.2, qmtest and qmtest_remote must share the same
database. Who actually compares
the expected stdout and stdin to what the test produced, qmtest or
qmtest_remote? My guess is qmtest_remote.
Likewise, who generates the result file? My hope is qmtest.

Here's my motivation for asking: I want to run several test targets
which have only read-only copies of the
test database. The targets don't NFS mount the test database. But I
still want a single machine, running
qmtest gui <etc>, to aggregate the results from the target machines. So
I need to know how the results
make it back to qmtest...

Subject: adding --pid switch to qmtest?
Message-ID: <000601c2494c$c32996a0$196fa8c0@usys.com>

When I run qmtest gui <etc>, I'd like it to print out
the pid into a file, say /var/run/qmtest.pid. What's the
"right" way of doing that? I'm thinking I want to modify
the command line processing to take an optional --pid <path>
switch and then modify qm/qm/web.py's WebServer class to write
out os.getpid() to a file.

If I have the pid in a file, then I write a bash script to be
placed in /etc/rc.d/init.d/qmtest (say) that can stop/restart/status
the running server.

Yes, that should work.

Subject: Mutually Exclusive Resources
Message-ID: <3D6B424C.5F917D5D@enea.se>

Hello,

I'm writing test suites for embedded targets using QMTest and I have
chosen to implement a resource class for booting the embedded board with
a specific boot image. We also have test cases that needs to be run
against different boot images and hence will depend on different boot
image resources. Of course a specific board/target can only run one boot
image at a time so a specific boot image resource is mutually exclusive
with any other boot image resource.

Here is what I would like to do:
(1) Add an attribute to the resource class that means that instances of
that resource is mutually exclusive with other instances of that class.

(2) Write an execution engine that (a) postpone the set up of such a
resource until there is no other test cases that can be run on that
target and (b) cleans up any existing resource of that class before
setting up the new resource.

Does this make sense and if so, are there others that could use mutually
exclusive resources?

Regards,
Sven Lundblad, OSE Systems

Subject: how to submit patches
Message-ID: <1030562355.2279.7.camel@twice.usys.com>

I'm making a few changes to qmtest 1.1.5 to allow for
start/stop/restart/status of qmtest gui on RH7.3 as a
daemon using /sbin/service. I'd like to submit a patch
back to codesourcery.com so they can bless it if it
passes muster. How should I do this? Here's my guess:

tar -zxf qm-1.1.5.tar.gz
cp -r qm-1.1.5 qm-1.1.5-carifio
cd qm-1.1.5-carifio
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/carifio
make; make install
# /usr/local/bin/qmtest is official 1.1.5
# /usr/local/carifio/bin/qmtest is my modified version

... make the changes, test the changes, be the changes ...

cd .. # qm-1.1.5 and qm-1.1.5-carifio are siblings
diff -u qm-1.1.5 qm-1.1.5-carifio > modifications.patch
mail -s "mods" somewhere at codesourcery.com < modifications.patch

If there's a better way to do this, now's a "teachable moment". Thanks.

Subject: a "status bar" at the bottom of the gui or a "you are here" page
Message-ID: <1030562611.2299.12.camel@twice.usys.com>

I'll be running multiple versions of qmtest gui on a machine. It
would be nice if there was a status page or "status bar" at the
bottom/top/side of a page that tell me what the pathname for
the test database is, so if http://penguin.usys.com:8888 maps
to /home/qmtest/testdbs/testdb1 and http://penguin.usys.com:8889
maps to /home/qmtest/testdbs/testdb2, then I can recover that
info without having to keep track of which website maps to which
test database.

I'm quibbling of course.

You'll want to use diff -ru, or it won't do what you expect.  If you
create new files, use -N to get them picked up (and make sure you
haven't any junk in either directory).

> mail -s "mods" somewhere at codesourcery.com < modifications.patch

somewhere@ can be this list.  Please include with your patch a
detailed description of what you have changed and why, so we know what
it's supposed to achieve.
