Can you detail how you planned the classes to indicate that arguments should 
be comptued? The simplest way I see is to allow declaring either class 
variable 'arguments' or function 'arguments'. In the former case that 
function will return final arguments list. It will be easy to implement 
(AFAIKT, there's only one place where arguments list are computed) and I can 
do it.

I don't follow you here. Can you explain?

Message-ID: <23220000.1021488480@gandalf.codesourcery.com>

QMTest 1.1.4 is now available at:

  http://www.codesourcery.com/qm/qmtest

This release contains a few bug fixes for usability issues, including:

  The QMTest GUI no longer crashes when the "Cancel" button is hit when
  creating a new test suite.

  Commands like "qmtest create-tdb --attribute X=Y" where "Y" contains
  spaces are now handled correctly.

Also, the Windows QMTest binaries are now built with Python 2.2, since
many QMTest users have indicated that they have upgraded to that version
of Python.

I'm sorry it took me so long to reply to this mail.

What I meant by a computed argument was one that was a function of other
arguments.  The important invariant is that derived classes have all of
the arguments of base classes -- and maybe more.  There's no reason,
however, that the derived classes shouldn't be able to compute some
of the base class attributes.  So:

  class X(Test):

    arguments = [ "x" ]

  class Y(X):

    arguments = [ "y" ]

Perhaps "x" can be computed from "y".  Then, there's no reason that
the creator of a Y test should have to specify a value for "x".  We
want to have a way to specify two things:

  1. That the test database, and the GUI, should not store or display
     the value for "x" when showing a Y test.

  2. That the value of y be gotten by computing x.

I haven't figured out yet what the cleanest way to do that in the
code is.

That's pretty strange; I've never seen that before.

What operating system are you  using?  What version of QMTest?  What
version of Pthon?

Also, do you know whether the database that you're working with is
one created by this version of QMTest, or a previous version?

Thanks,

This is running on a linux 2.5.15 box, python version 2.2.1, qmtest 1.1.5,
and using the tutorial test database that came with qmtest.

Does it make any difference if you use an absolute path:

  /path/to/qmtest/bin/qmtest gui

?

Is your PYTHONPATH non-empty?  What about your QMTEST_CLASS_PATH?

(Try setting both to empty.)

Do you read Python?  If so, I could help you debug the problem.

Thanks,

I get the same error when I added the qmtest directory to my PATH.  My
PYTHONPATH is empty, and it made no difference.  I'll try to read whatever
python you send me.. I need to be conversant in python :-)  Thanks!

Subject: Storing test input files
Message-ID: <B91C5A40.4252%Gilles.Depeyrot@wanadoo.fr>

Hi,

I am a new user (just starting) so please bear with me if my questions are
real simple...

I am going to start building a testsuite using QMTest. This test suite will
be aimed at testing a command line program that will be passed commands (on
standard input) and will use separate input files (one or more) for each
test.

Where is the best place to store the input files? Can these files be moved
into the test database directories created by QMTest?

Concerning the QMTest test database itself, am I correct assuming it is fine
to store the whole database in a CVS repository?

Regards,
Gilles

Subject: Windows XP problems.
Message-ID: <00af01c20882$91623ba0$5c1a7f0a@cd>

 Hi!

  I've just started to play with qmtest and it looks great, but
as Windows user I have had some problems.  Sorry if these
are already discussed or are otherwise rtfm stuff.

  I don't wish to install some external shell so I used
cmd.exe undex Windows XP, which requires that script
file or shellcommand is given after /C and that filename
which is run has suffix .bat (or suffix from register).
qm.platform.get_shell_for_command added "/c" but
qm.platofmr_get_shell_for_script didn't.

Also, qm.platform.default_shell used environment
variable "COMPSPEC" while it was "COMSPEC" in my
machine.

After that it works as far as command excution is
concerned, but output doesn't match.  They look identical
in browser, so I guess it's end-of-line issue, browser or
OS specific.  Would it be a good idea to split by line
endings and compare results?

My system is Windows XP Pro, Internet Explorer 6,
Python 2.2.1 and QMTest 1.1.5

I might be blind, but online manual seem to be available
only from download page.


Regards,
Esa
