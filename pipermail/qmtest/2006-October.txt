Subject: qmtest issues on Windows XP
Message-ID: <5e450c4d0610110129x45f30f2bw98bacca6861009b4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
    I have the 2.3 version of QMTest installed on Windows and use the
gui tool to add and run test cases to the tdb. I am seeing two
important issues with QMTest when running them on Windows XP. I was
wondering if anyone has a resolution for this. I am seeing these
issues only on Windows XP and not on the Linux installation.

1) If my test runs for a long time when invoked from the gui, ( say
about 10 -20 seconds ) the webpage (I use firefox) loses connection
after a few seconds to the localhost qmtest-server and reports that
the connection to the peer is lost. Refreshing the webpage does not
help. I have to manually go to the results directory from the webpage
to see the results. In contrast, on Linux, after a couple of seconds
it goes to another webpage that says that the results will be updated
every few seconds and not all tests have completed. Once the tests
finish the results are updated. I am not sure if this has anything to
do with the configuration for the webpage. If so, how do I configure
it for this problem to go away?

2) If my test takes too long to run due to a failure, and I specify a
particular timeout on the qmtest script, the test case does not work
as expected on Windows XP. Even after specifying a timeout, the test
continues to run beyond this timeout and finishes when it has too with
no relevance to the timeout at all. On Linux, the test gets killed
after the timeout and the return error code indicates this. If this is
a known issue, is there a way or a patch to fix it that is available
or will be available soon?

I am not sure if these are known issues or if they are happening
because my configuration is buggy. If anyone has encountered this
problem or has a solution for this please do let us know about it.

Thanks,
 Shiva

Subject: Tutorial script gave me an outcome of 'ERROR'
Message-ID: <45398394.6050001@spawnordie.com>

Hello Everyone!

I just found QMTest yesterday and started the tutorial after installing 
it today.  I was following along with the tutorial on QMTest when I got 
to this section:

http://www.codesourcery.com/public/qmtest/qm-2.3/manual.html/sec-testtut-modifying.html

After following the instructions I got a result of 'ERROR' for the 
outcome of the test created on the page above.  I'm not sure if I messed 
up somewhere (the tutorial has been quite accurate so far), if so, I'd 
like to know where I made my mistake.

Here is the output from the "Details" link of the "command.test1" test:

Here is the source code created from following the steps of the tutorial:

Troy,

I have seen this stacktrace before, and further investigation let me to
believe this was a bug in either the kernel or glibc, so I submitted a
but report to RH:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=188578

It has been a while since the problem disappeared, and I'm unable to
tell whether it was due to a kernel or library upgrade, or something
entirely different.
Out of curiosity, what platform are you running on ('uname -a',
glibc version, python version, etc.) ?

Thanks,
		Stefan

Subject: patch: new CommandHost extension.
Message-ID: <453EE2F3.80406@codesourcery.com>

The attached patch adds a new command_host.CommandHost host extension
that can be used to run an executable by means of some command.

(Example: MPI applications may be started using the 'mpirun' command.)

Applied.

Thanks,
