I don't claim to have reviewed all the traffic; just the summary you
posted.  Some of the cons were not accurate; I'm not sure if that's true
of all of them.

&gt;<i> 1. The last update to QMTest was in 2008. Has the current features of

No.  We're using it on recent Ubuntu, but not on other systems.

&gt;<i>     Our project pass 'make check/distcheck/clean/distclean'. Most of our

You would certainly have to do some refactoring.  You would end up with
&quot;make check&quot; running &quot;qmtest ...&quot; to actually run the tests, and you'd
want the tests themselves to be organized within QMTest.

&gt;<i>     of testing. One of my biggest questions is how to support libtool
</I>&gt;<i> since we don't install libraries or 
</I>&gt;<i>     programs before building and testing.
</I>
QMTest has the concept of a &quot;resource&quot; -- i.e., a set-up step that
occurs before some tests run.

&gt;<i> 3. How is the usability of QMTest when testing locally on a developers
</I>&gt;<i> machine? 'make check' can 
</I>&gt;<i>     easily run the tests for a directory at a time, and if required it

</I>
Running &quot;qmtest run&quot; is approximately the same as running &quot;make check&quot;
in that respect.

The basic tradeoff is that you will spend more time setting things up
with qmtest in order to leverage its more-structured environment.

I would not characterize either DejaGNU or QMTest as &quot;products&quot; at this
point; they're useful technologies.  If you want to be successful with
either one, you might want to engage someone to help; otherwise, it's
going to be a fair amount of digging about on your own.
