Subject: patch for qmtest 1.1.5 that integrates 'qmtest gui' as a service
 on RedHat
Message-ID: <3D77AB5A.9020609@usys.com>

Summary: I've attached a patch file for qmtest-1.1.5 that adds the 
ability to run qmtest as a service on RH 7.3. This means you can have
the qmtest gui come up when the machine boots and you can 
start/stop/reload/status with /sbin/service.

The patch adds a new switch to 'qmtest gui', namely --pidfile 
<pathname>. This pathname indicates where to put the pid for the
http (zope) process. The default is /var/run/qmtest.pid. As currently
implemented, a pidfile is always written out on startup, but you might
want it to be optional. It seemed to make sense that it was available.

I created a 'contrib' directory and put the service start up script
qmtest.in there. Configure creates the service startup script qmtest 
from it. There's an associated qmtest.conf file for the service startup
script if you don't like its defaults. I did NOT modify 'make install' 
to install these scripts. They're RedHat specific. Also should they be
moved to ${prefix}/sbin or /etc/rc.d/init.d, where RedHat expects them?

I modified configure.in to generate contrib/qmtest from contrib/qmtest.in.

I modified GNUmakefile.in by adding two new targets: 'tags', to make an
emacs tags file (TAGS) and 'diff' to assist in making patch files.
The diff target needs some work. You'll see why below.

The patch file modifies: configure.in, GNUmakefile.in, 
qm/test/cmdline.py and qm/platform_unix.py. It adds the directory
contrib and files contrib/qmtest.in, contrib/qmtest.conf. Other
cruft has crept in, including qm/build. I'm not sure what qm/build
does, but I'm sure its generated and I didn't fool with the patch file.

It would be nice if there was a README.contributor that tutored the
newbie (me) in how to add to qmtest. In particular, I've been going
through the fairly slow cycle of:

         ... change something ...
         $ autoconf  # when changing configure.in
         $ ./configure
         $ make
         $ make check
         $ make install
         ... test my changes here ...

I believe it would be possible, and far more expedient, to be able to 
run qmtest "in place" where I'm editing the sources so that I can 
immediately see the effects of my changes. But I don't know how to
do this. A better 'make diff' would also help feed changes back in.
For example, 'make install' compiles files and moves them to ${prefix}
and its subdirectories. But when I'm developing, I don't need to move
files around, right?

I did a lot of work for not many code changes in the end. Some of this 
is learning curve, but others will have similar learning curves. 
Shouldn't we lessen the slope of the curve, if we can? I'll volunteer to 
help with this, but others might be more capable and better suited.
In particular, it it would be nice if test classes (qm/test/classes)
could be aggregated and reused.

If these adds are considered appropriate, I'd like them to be folded 
into the main trunk so that I don't have to add them with each new
snapshot. Please send me some email on what you decide. Thanks.

I surely could use this as well so I also hope it gets into the main line. The 
functionality seams very sound to me.

If I do a 'make install' over a previously installed directory, do
the python scripts get recompiled? I thought the .py -> .pyc compilation
was automatic and happened anytime .py is newer than .pyc? That
doesn't seem to be happening when I do a 'make install'. Please
advise at your convenience. Thanks.

Folks, correct me if I am wrong, but as far as I know, the .py -> .pyc
compilation happens when the .py file is loaded by the Python
interpreter.  It would make sense for timestamps to be checked by the
interpreter to avoid unnecessary work.  I don't think 'make install'
has anything to do with this step.

This is true.  However, we do want to generate all the .pyc and .pyo
files at installation time (using the handy compile_all.py that comes
with the interpreter), because the end user may not have write
privileges on the directory in which qmtest is installed.  I *think*
setup.py handles this automatically but I could be wrong.

Subject: qmtest gui question
Message-ID: <001a01c25bf4$29380440$196fa8c0@usys.com>

Suppose I run qmtest gui (zope) with --address <myhost> --port 8888.
Then I can have two users, say user0 and user1, who can use the
website. What happens if user0 kicks off a test suite and then
a little later user1 kicks off the same suite? Is there anything
that stops user1 from stomping on user0's run? It seems to me
that the website is a "single user" website?

What I want is a mechanism that lets a team of developers see
the nightly test run from the website. But for tests that fail,
I can see the curious trying to run the a failing test again
immediately from the website to see if the failure always happens
or is intermittent. So the user0/user1 scenario isn't just an
abstraction...

Correct.

Adding a lot more in the way of report-generation (as opposed to simply
viewing a current run) are planned, as are various sorts of
permissions.  However, it's unclear when we'll get to those -- as
customers ask us for particular things, we add them.

Yours,

Subject: qmtest-1.1.5 patch to handle tests with no matching target
Message-ID: <3D91D3C5.130AF011@enea.se>

Hi all,

We use qmtest 1.1.5 with different target specification files to control
on which targets tests run. However qmtest 1.1.5 hangs and never exists
if there are tests that do not match any target so we made a patch in
the execution engine to remove tests that can never be run (due to lack
of a target).

We more or less consider this to be a bug in qmtest, do you guys agree?

Regards,
Sven Lundblad

Subject: Test cases which require variation of the input
Message-ID: <20020928004622.GG1115@codesourcery.com>

I just investigated a bug in GCC's preprocessor which caused it to
crash on input of the form

#define S(x) #x

S(1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
  1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
  1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
  /* ... */
  123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678)

S()
S()
/* ... 14 more S() here */

S(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)
S(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)

with a nasty catch: the required length of the filler text 12345...
varied with the version of the buggy compiler, the build parameters,
and the command line arguments.  This was because the bug was
triggered only by using S() with an empty argument when an internal
buffer was exactly full.

For this sort of bug, a static test case offers no assurance that the
bug has not reappeared.  All you know is that the bug has not
reappeared under the exact set of conditions described by the test
case.  It's relatively simple to instrument the preprocessor to find
out whether the problematic edge case is being hit, but you don't want
the instrumentation in the production executable.

So I'm wondering how QMTest can help with this.  What comes to mind is
a test class which takes a template and a set of parameters to vary,
and generates a whole series of test inputs; hopefully at least one of
them will hit the edge.  This is brute force.  Anyone have a better
idea?

That sounds like what I would do.  Another option would be a test
database that instantiated the template as a zillion different tests,
but that's probably not as nice.

I can't think what else you could do; if you can only perceive the
failure with certain inputs, then you need to be generating those
inputs, which is going to require some sort of enumeration of
possibilities.

Yes, this is a bug.  We have reworked the execution engine stuff
substantially since 1.1.5 to remove this and other deadlocks; you can
try out CVS or wait for QMTest 2.0, which should be ready pretty soon.

A variant of Mike's patches have been checked in on the trunk, and will
appear in QMTest 2.0.
