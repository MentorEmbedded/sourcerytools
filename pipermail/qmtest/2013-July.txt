Hello Suresha,

The official download site for QMTest is here:

      https://github.com/MentorEmbedded/qmtest

I am fairly certain that QMTest does not support Python 3.  The most
recent QMTest release (2.4.1) occurred nearly at same time as the
release of Python 3.

Since this is open source software, pull requests implementing Python
3 support in QMTest are welcome.  :-)

Thanks,
