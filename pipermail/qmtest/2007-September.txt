Hi.

I downloaded (from svn) the qmtest sources.
setup build seems to have worked
But setup build_doc gives the following

Should there be the -o option to fop?

That's possible. I wrote the build_doc command quite a while ago,
and there have been new fop releases after that point. May be fop's
UI has changed ? What fop version are you using ?

Thanks,

Subject: patch: Enhance MountDatabase
Message-ID: <46F15B8F.2020604@codesourcery.com>

The attached patch enhances the MountDatabase by allowing to
specify sub-databases not directly stored as sub-directories
of the database directory.

The field used to represent the mount points is a DictionaryField.
As DictionaryFields can't be represented as text yet, there is
no way to create MountDatabases with that parameter on the
command line. Instead, the extension (XML) file for it needs to
be edited manually.

In addition to this new feature, the patch fixes the MountDatabase.GetIds()
method.

Thanks,
		Stefan

A good starting point is the command that defines how the tutorial
is built. It is in qmdist/command/build_doc.py. There you will find
the code that creates and issues the fop command.
(Does fop provide a way to check its version ? Or does fop 0.93 use
 the same command-line interface ?)

I'm not sure what you are aiming at. What do you mean by 'xml module'
and why do you want to replace it ? The customizable parts in QMTest
are the 'extensions' (test database, test, result stream, etc.).
These are the ones which you may want to add to to suite your own
needs
