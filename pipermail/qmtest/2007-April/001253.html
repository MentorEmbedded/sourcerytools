I'm running Ubuntu feisty (7.04) and got errors related (I guess) to ExceptionTest class in qm/test/classes/python.py . Maybe the reason is the differences between the traceback format on python2.4 and python2.5, as you can see in the example below:
</I>
Indeed, there are some issues with QMTest &amp; python 2.5. I already resolved a major problem by
upgrading some Zope modules used as part of the GUI. More changes are planned.
Most of QMTest should work find with Python 2.5, though.

Thanks for pointing out the ExceptionTest issue. I'll look into it more, since I don't yet
understand what change in Python's exception handling causes it. (And yes, I would appreciate
any solution you may already have come up with !)


&gt;<i> I'd like to contribute to qmtest and I think that the better way to start would be with small changes.
</I>
Great !

&gt;<i> Would you like to receive patches changing the code to use some PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)?
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestions are the pep-0008[0], pep-0257[1], pep-0290[2].
</I>
&gt;<i>From looking at the PEPs you mention I take it you are most interested in stylistic cleanup (as
</I>opposed to new features, or fixes to open issues). Correct ?

&gt;<i> And how about changing modules to use subprocess[3] as a command executer, and other similar changes?
</I>
As much as I'd appreciate any cleanup, it is important to remain backward compatible (such as with
Python 2.3, which doesn't have the subprocess module).

&gt;<i> BTW, any plans to release a new version? When?
</I>
There are no concrete plans (neither concerning any date, nor a feature set).
I'm currently working on a new GUI (still using some Zope modules) that will hopefully be
more flexible and easy to customize.
I also have a new 'Expectation Database' type in the works that allows to more flexibly
and conveniently handle expectations and the way they are specified and stored.
Finally, there is some efford going into API cleanup.

If you have any particular things you'd like to see enhanced in QMTest, I'm very much interested
to know about them. (Contributions are certainly appreciated, too, though it would be good to
coordinate first to avoid to waste anyone's effort.)

Thanks,
		Stefan
