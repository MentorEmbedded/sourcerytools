Dear All,
                Greetings !!
I am a newbie to the ARM processors but have worked with micro
controllers in general for quite some time. I recently got my hands on the
STM32F4 Discovery board(the price was the real motivation I would admit
)and started exploring all that I could do with it.
Going through the various resources that I could get my hands on I could
set up the GNU tool chain for the eclipse environment and debug a simple
LED blinking code.
So, I decided to give try out some of the bigger projects such as the audio
player example given in the ST code examples. After putting every single
path on the includes , folder and the related source folders(I followed the
Atollic directory structure) I am getting the following errors.

*"D:/eclipse_indigo/stm32f4discovery_fw/STM32F4-Discovery_FW_V1.1.0/Project/Audio_playback_and_record/inc/usb_conf.h:139:6:
error: #error "USB_OTG_HS_CORE or USB_OTG_FS_CORE should be defined"*
*D:/eclipse_indigo/stm32f4discovery_fw/STM32F4-Discovery_FW_V1.1.0/Project/Audio_playback_and_record/inc/usb_conf.h:152:6:
error: #error "USE_USB_OTG_HS or USE_USB_OTG_FS should be defined"*
*cs-make: *** [temp_folder/usb_bsp.o] Error 1"*

While this may seem as simple problems related to the path/symbols  not
being included, that does not seem to be the case.
Kindly point me in the right direction.

By looking at the above the error it is quite self explanatory - you
need to setup the st usb libs correctly.

As you are using gcc included with Atollic, i would guess

Hello Spencer,
                      Many thanks for your reply. I am trying to build a
custom opensource tool chain , I could get the atollic tool chain to work.
without much effort. But, it has a code limitation of 32K , that I cannot
live with at the moment.
So I searched on the internet and could come up with the following option.
Project details:
Board: STM32F4 Discovery
IDE: Eclipse Indigo
Compiler: Code sourcery G++ Lite
Debugger: Atollic
I could run the LED blinking example but was facing the problem that I
mentioned for the sample wave project. So, that's the long story short..
I may sound dumb but, what do you mean by setting up the usb libraries
correctly, do you wnat me to edit the libraries, or some header file ? I
could try the latter, but dont have much expertise with the former..

Subject: [arm-gnu] strtoull - Newlib C Library - NoGo
Message-ID: <1345147820.4666.39.camel@seng-P560>

Hello,

for me there is a problem with the use of the Newlib C Library
(1.18.0-sg++) (stdlib.h) included in ?Sourcery CodeBench Lite?. When
including function ?strtoull? in program code, communication via USART
switches to baudrate x 4 (?!), sometimes HardFault_Handler interrupt
occurs.
No error messages, no warnings during compile and run (when not
HardFault), other part of program seems to run correctly. Same behavior
when using 2011.03 / 2011.09 and 2012.03 versions of Sourcery Codebench
Lite.
Function ?strtoul? seems to be not affected, other functions out of this
library are working without problems since months.

Any ideas?

Look for stack corruption when you call strtoull?

Is the stack correctly aligned when the function call is made?

Is another function misaligning the stack?

Cheers,
Carlos.

Message-ID: <CAPfzE3ZZu-mJq6U3N+yNTX9k2O+kqpw+Em1EOAHcfPNAGr942A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm doing some work under Linux on a Cortex-A9 system, and having some
difficulty getting a working compiler. I've tried both arm-2012.03-57
and arm-2011.09-70, but each of them suffers from a different GLIBC
bug. I'm trying to avoid doing a compiler build, as this has always
given me grief in the past. Does anyone know if there is a new 2012
release expected soon?

For reference, the bugs I'm hitting are:
2011.09: http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12454
2012.03: http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13906

Andre

The releases are typically Spring then Fall.

I can't comment on when the next Lite edition release will be out,
or if it will contain the fix for BZ#13906.

We do offer the option of buying a Professional edition 
subscription with support, through which you can request a
release of the commercial product with a fix for BZ#13906.

Cheers,
Carlos.

Subject: [arm-gnu]  strtoull - Newlib C Library - No
Message-ID: <1346249784.1894.7.camel@seng-P560>

Hello,

Already increased stack size --> same result.
replaced "strtoull" by some source-code I fished from the net. Hopefully
started the program - and had the same result...

Identified the following sequence inside the code that leads to the
strange result:
long long test1 = 10, test2 = 4, test3;
test3 = test1 / test2;

As soon as the code of a division of a long long variable exists inside
the program (no matter where), the program shows the strange results.
Think that the code of strtoull contains a division too.

Manual "Using the GNU Compiler Collection, chapter 6.9" tells that long
long divisions are open coded and are available only on machines
'providing special support'.
So the solution is just to not use long long division, which is OK for
me.
It would be just of interest for me how the code of the division can
alter the program in a way that:
+ everything still works
+ debug functionality is still fine
+ even the result of the long long division is OK
- the baudrate changes to baudrate X 4 (which is defined by the content
of a CPU-register, not by the translated code itself)
Any Ideas?

Hi

I am using Make File project to compile C code for My ARM7 ADuC7020 uC

Compiler: BIN=C:/CodeSourcery/Sourcery_CodeBench_Lite_for_ARM_EABI/bin/arm-none-eabi-

I am also using freeRTOS.

I am using PC-LINT V8.00 and would like to know if there are any option.lnt files anywhere that can help sort out problems with the stdint.h that sre ARM7 / Code Sourcery Lite specific

There are so many errors i can't even lint my code.

Thanks
