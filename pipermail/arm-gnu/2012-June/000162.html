<PRE>So it looks like it was the stack alignment problem. Unfortunately, I just can't read :(

I had __attribute__ ((align (8))) and I missed GCC's warning stating it was ignoring the attribute align. It should read __attribute__ ((aligned (8))).

Thanks for all your help!

Cheers,
Mark

So this sounds like something is breaking the stack boundary requirements.

Can you look at the stack alignment at entry to several functions?

No, I was just generically stating that there could be an unfound bug, but I don't know of any.

What about the one in the STM32 Firmware Library?

Cheers,
Carlos.
