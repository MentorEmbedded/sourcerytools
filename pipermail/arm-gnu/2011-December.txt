I'm not completely sure whether it works (with all the recent
changes), but the mailman page for the list (listed at the end of
messages sent by the list) can be found here:

I've forwarded your request on to the appropriate people.

I'm sorry that this information appears to have been lost in the shuffle.

Let's not jump to pessimistic conclusions.  I'm sure the change of 
ownership meant a number of changes, and some delays while things 
stabilise is not unexpected, but my understanding is that CodeSourcery 
development continues much as it always has done.  It could also be that 
there have been changes in emphasis or priority - after all, ARM gcc is 
only one of CodeSourcery's products, and the combination of Mentor and 
CodeSourcery must figure out where their products complement each other, 
and where they compete with themselves.

As long as we continue to see posts from CodeSourcery email addresses in 
the gcc development mailing list, we can see that the team are still 
pulling gcc forward.  And as "giant monsters" go, I think one could do a 
lot worse than Mentor.  They need gcc, so it's in their interest to help 
develop it further, and they have always had a reputation for quality 
tools (though their price-points have traditionally been higher than 
CodeSourcery's).

Of course, I've no inside information, and have no idea when the next 
release will be out - but I certainly don't think it's time to give up 
on CodeSourcery.

mvh,.

David

David, thank you for the kind words!

We are, as you say, very much continuing on our traditional path within Mentor.  Of course, our business continues to evolve, but we're still very much focused on the GNU toolchain.

The next ARM Lite Edition release will be available shortly.  We are working through a number of web and release issues, as all of our web infrastructure has been recently updated as part of our transition into Mentor, but the development of the Fall 2011 is very nearly complete, and you can expect an announcement here shortly.

Thank you,

Mark Mitchell

Thanks for the information mark. The only reason I asked was to know if the
transition was over and if it brought with it any process changes that we
users might need to know.

Message-ID: <CAD5x=MNm37D0SgusfbQJk-2O1c_uA_Nu-m8XPOHbQ=zVwfUhGg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,


As we know, generally, we run bt command in gdb, gdb show the seg fault
location in last backtrace.

I found one strange behaviour If i run  bt command in gdb, at that itme,
gdb didn?t show the segment  fault location in backtrace by default.

Can some one tell the reason
and is this expected in SMP

That's normal, `bt' shows only the backtrace for the last active thread.

You must run `thread apply backtrace' (or some shortcut form) to get a backtrace of *all* threads to see which one most likely faulted.

I assume you are going remote debug.

Until you fix the "warning: ..." you're going to have problems debugging anything with threads.

The warning indicates that gdb, and the target do not agree about the libraries they are using for debugging.

You must keep the target in sync with the runtimes you use for debugging, otherwise debugging is unreliable.

Cheers,
Carlos.

Hi Carlos/Santosa,

After detail dump analysis I found current thread crash with
malloc_consolidate function only

Thanks a Lot.

Thanks,
