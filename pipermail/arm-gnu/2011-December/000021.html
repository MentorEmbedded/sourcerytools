Let's not jump to pessimistic conclusions.  I'm sure the change of 
ownership meant a number of changes, and some delays while things 
stabilise is not unexpected, but my understanding is that CodeSourcery 
development continues much as it always has done.  It could also be that 
there have been changes in emphasis or priority - after all, ARM gcc is 
only one of CodeSourcery's products, and the combination of Mentor and 
CodeSourcery must figure out where their products complement each other, 
and where they compete with themselves.

As long as we continue to see posts from CodeSourcery email addresses in 
the gcc development mailing list, we can see that the team are still 
pulling gcc forward.  And as &quot;giant monsters&quot; go, I think one could do a 
lot worse than Mentor.  They need gcc, so it's in their interest to help 
develop it further, and they have always had a reputation for quality 
tools (though their price-points have traditionally been higher than 
CodeSourcery's).

Of course, I've no inside information, and have no idea when the next 
release will be out - but I certainly don't think it's time to give up 
on CodeSourcery.

mvh,.
