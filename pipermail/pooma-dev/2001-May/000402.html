<PRE>Hi All,

I just wanted to apologize for jumping in and patching
the DomainTraits.h file.  I was at Caltech yesterday
and had not seen the flurry of e-mails between Jeffrey
and Jim regarding this problem and possible ways of 
fixing it.  In any event, I recognized that this issue
with the DomainTraits.int.h file possibly not being included
early enough was a potential problem when I was working
on the Domain sources previously.  Since the problem
popped up yet again, I figured I should just fix it.

I do think my fix is appropriate.  DomainTraits.int.h 
contains specializations of the DomainTraits template.
These have to be seen before the template is instantiated.
Since it can be terribly complicated to figure out exactly
where a template is first being instantiated sometimes,
it is easiest to just include the specializations right
away.  So I just included DomainTraits.int.h at the end
of DomainTraits.h (and removed all other includes of
DomainTraits.int.h).  This solves the problem permanently.

I don't think that a major overhaul/rewrite of the Domain
sources is a good use of Allan's time or anyone else's
at this moment.  These sources reach into absolutely all
parts of Pooma, and there will inevitably be problems and
surprises if we swap out the Domain sources entirely.
Although the present source is perhaps overly complex,
it does work correctly.  I think there's plenty of other
stuff that is actually broken or needs to be completed
to keep us all happily busy for some time to come.  Just
my two cents on this issue.

I support Scott's suggestions for issue tracking and taking
discussions of particular patches offline if they become
extended.  Just add a note that you are taking a discussion offline, and whoever is interested can continue with it.
I have been frustrated by some of the endless discussions
about suggested patches.  E-mail is usually not an efficient
means of resolving these issues.  We should probably be 
picking up the phone a little more often.

On the delete_test issue: I will leave it to Jim and Jeffrey
to come up with a solution that works and is portable across
the various platforms and compilers we support.  I had 
forgotten that I had to comment out the memmove() stuff 
because it did not work under the Intel VTune compiler (or
the gcc compiler as Jeffrey discovered).  That's why I
commented out the code rather than delete it entirely.  If
there is a strong reason for maintaining the use of memmove
and someone can make it work portably, please do so.

Thanks, Julian C.
