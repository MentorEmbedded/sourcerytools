<PRE>Dave,

I don't have an account on chi, but I do have an account
on the Compaq TeraScale machine at Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center.  It has the same Compaq Tru64 operating system, but
I don't think they have KCC installed.  I should probably
have a look at building Pooma 2 there using the Compaq compiler.
I might be able to help Lee with Pooma 1 issues, but it would
make more sense to get an account on your chi machine first.

Julian C.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I agree that the numbers I reported imply something strange going on with our 
</I>&gt;<i>SGI machine/compilers.  I thought it was strange enough that it should be
</I>&gt;<i>reported to pooma-dev in case you guys had some insight into the problem that 
</I>&gt;<i>I was missing.  I'm not really looking for a platform specific solution from
</I>&gt;<i>you guys.  Actually, my data indicates a temporary work around for the SGI is 
</I>&gt;<i>to just break up my files into much smaller files since the SGI C compiler
</I>&gt;<i>seems to scale more like quadratic with the size of the .int.c files.  Of
</I>&gt;<i>course I already have what I thought might be reasonable granularity there.
</I>&gt;<i>The instantiation requests for the Pooma 2 assign functions are currently
</I>&gt;<i>spread over 20 files.  I probably need to talk to someone from SGI about this 
</I>&gt;<i>data and see if they know what is going on as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I think that the SGI platform will be an important platform for our October 1 
</I>&gt;<i>deadline.  To my knowledge, Lee Ankeny has not been successful yet getting
</I>&gt;<i>any of our Pooma 1 based code compiling on the Compaq machines.  Perhaps that 
</I>&gt;<i>will change with the recent release of KCC-4.0e for Tru64 Unix 5.0.  BTW, do
</I>&gt;<i>you guys have accounts on the chi machine - an open Compaq machine?  I was
</I>&gt;<i>under the impression that you were supposed to have accounts there now.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i>worried about what compile times are going to be like on the Compaq as well.
</I>&gt;<i>I don't know enough about the machine yet but I wonder if our parallel builds 
</I>&gt;<i>will be limited to 4 processors.
