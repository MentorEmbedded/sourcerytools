<PRE>Hi Guys,

I wanted to share some results which I have accumulated over the last week or 
so regarding compile times and Pooma 2.  Some of these results I find to be
truly stunning in a negative sense.  First, I spent most of last week trying
to build a couple of versions of my Pooma2Instantiations library on the
secure bluemountain b18 machine.  I built a debug and an optimized version of 
the library using KCC-4.0d.  I had the source code for Pooma 2 and the
Pooma2Instantiations library located on the local scratch disk.  I was doing
a parallel using 16 processors including 16 processors for the parallel
prelink phase.  The timing results which I will be reporting were accumulated 
this last Friday when b18 was virtually idle except for my compiles.  The
stunning result is that I could build either a debug or optimized version of
the library faster on my 2 year old 366 MHz Pentium 2 laptop with 384 MBytes
of memory than I could on an idle b18 using 16 processors.  I find this
result to be truly stunning.  The majority of the compile time, at least 90%, 
on b18 was spent in the backend C compiler.  Here are some timings that I did 
on 5 files that were associated with instantiating the Pooma 2 global assign
function on both b18 and my old laptop.  The timing results are not totally
comparable because the prelinker chooses to assign templates a little
differently from one machine to the other because of doing a parallel compile 
on b18.  These compiles were +K0 compiles using KCC-4.0d.  Anyway, here they
are:

It seems that on my linux laptop, gcc's compile time scales roughly linearly
with the number of lines of intermediate C code.  That does not seem to be
the case for the SGI cc compiler.  I computed these results using both the
MipsPro 7.2.1 C compiler and the MipsPro 7.3.1.2m C compiler and the results
were essentially identical for practical purposes.

Another experiment which I did was to take the instantiation request for the
assign function which had the longest template argument and put that in a
separate file and do some testing on my linux laptop.  The longest template
argument was 1666 characters in length.  Here are the results with and
without exceptions enabled.

With Exceptions:
----------------

     | int C code |  Time   |    Level     | C code - base  | Time - base

  2  |   18263    |  35.27  |     +K1      |       37       |  12.33
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  3  |   12476    |  49.62  |     +K2      |       18       |  12.32

The results recorded in the &quot;base&quot; columns are results obtained when the
template instantiation request is commented out and reflects the compile
times and lines of intermediate C code for the case where only the included
header files are being parsed.  Care was taken to record the number of lines
of intermediate C code before the prelinker phase.  The prelinker phase
determines that the explicit instantiation request for this single assign
function triggers the need for an additional 292 templates and the lines of
intermediate C code for these additional 292 templates nearly doubles the
above numbers.  It seems amazing that a single assign function would need
between 14430 and 28750 lines of intermediate C code to represent it
depending on the optimization level and that it would trigger the need for
another 292 templates.  Also, I don't think we have gotten to the level of
complexity in the expressions for our Pooma 2 based code that we have in our
Pooma 1 based code.  In our Pooma 1 based code, I have seen expressions which 
generate template parameters over 2800 characters long.

Here is another benchmark to compare the Pooma 2 base code and the Pooma 1
based code.  In the Pooma 1 based code, my instantiation library explicitly
instantiated nearly every Pooma 1 template.  The +K1 compilation of this
instantiation library generated approximately 3.5 million lines of
intermediate C code for the whole library and just under 1 million lines for
the instantiation of all the global assign functions.  There were about 1196
of these global assign functions that were instantiated.  In constrast, the
Pooma 2 instantiation library instantiates 1282 global assign functions which 
generates 4711082 lines of intermediate C code.  The complete Pooma 2
instantiation library currently generates 5327932 lines of intermediate C
code.  However, there are still lots of Pooma 2 templates that are currently
being instantiated by the prelinker in our Blanca code that need to be moved
to the Pooma 2 instantiation library.  So, it appears that there is alot more 
intermediate C code generated by KCC for our Pooma 2 code than for our Pooma
1 code.  I'm not sure what to make of all this since to a certain degree I am 
comparing apples and oranges.  But I think it does provide some indication of 
how Pooma 1 and Pooma 2 compare in regard to code generation which
contributes to long compile times.

Also, I tried out Jeffrey's fixes to allow instantiation of the View1 class
and have some comments.  It appears that I can now instantiate the View1
class but now I find that I have about 1000 AltView1 templates that I am
unable to instantiate.  Perhaps we need a new AltAltView1 class:-).  Well,
seriously, this fix is not solving the root problem which I have which is
that I need to be able to explicitly instantiate anything that the compiler
is able to instantiate so that I don't have to depend on the prelinker
recompiling files.  Also, I tried the following template instantiation
request which did not work.

	template const bool View1&lt;Field&lt;T1,T2,T3&gt;,T4&gt;::sv;

KCC using --strict complained that I did not provide an implementation.  So,
I don't know what the problem is here.  I don't know if the syntax is wrong
or there is some bug in KCC.  But I do know that the prelinker is capable of
performing the instantiation of this member of the View1 class.  I have this
problem with other Pooma 2 classes such as the ElementProperties class.  I
wish I could get this problem solved because my compile times are at least
twice as long as they would be if I were able to instantiate everything that
the compiler is instantiating.

I would like to know what the Pooma 2 team things about these results.  I
find them sobering and not something that I want to see publicized.  Do you
guys have any ideas about how to modify the relevant parts of Pooma 2 so that 
less intermediate C code gets generated by KCC?  Are there tradeoffs here
that you are aware of?  Is this code generation problem related specifically
to the expression template engine or are there other things involved here?
I've been wondering lately if Pooma 2 was designed in a way that would make
it easy to use some other expression template engine.  I've also been
wondering whether it would be possible to make expression templates a feature 
selectable at compile time.  Then for debugging or development perhaps a more 
lightweight version of Pooma 2 could be used that would run like a dog but
compile much faster and facilitate an effective and efficient development
environment.  Then building a high performance runtime version of our code
could be banished to a batch script that was done only infrequently or by a
very small group of people.  Are things like this reasonable to contemplate
with Pooma 2?

Please let me know if you have any questions about the results I have
presented in this email or if I can supply additional information.  I plan to 
also send a copy of the current version of my Pooma 2 instantiation stuff so
you guys can do any testing of your own that you want to do.
