<PRE>Hi Mark,

If Allan were really going to write all of the documentation, I'd grant 
your last point. However, I think it is reasonable to suspect that 
Proximation folks will have a little to contribute in this area. 
Therefore, our concerns should be considered. We can also debate whether 
the world is headed to SGML or, as I suspect, XML. However, let's not.

We'll give DocBook a try subject to the caveat that we're not going to 
spend time porting this to MacOS X or Windows, which means that we may 
be checking in badly-formed files that others will have to debug. Also, 
if it sucks for us, we'll provide input in other forms and allow the 
DocBook boosters to convert. Sound fair?

Scott
