Hi Dave,

I have no doubt that we can improve compile times. However, I'm not sure 
what to make of your numbers. They imply that something strange is 
happening on the SGI, but that's not really our target platform, so I 
don't believe that we should spend much time looking into this right 
now. Our priorities are, as I understand it, to (1) provide core 
capabilities in order to allow you guys to meet your October deadline 
and (2) to optimize performance and scalability. I'd put compile time 
performance in (2), but the contract clearly implies we should focus on 
run time first. That said, it is worth a little more time to investigate 
this View preinstantiation issue because it can elucidate some design 
principles that can be used to reduce the number of template 
instantiations as we go forward. In the long term, I believe that we may 
need to provide a tool of some sort to support pre-instantiation, but 
that is not a job for now.

Scott
