<PRE>I just learned this afternoon that the chi machine has version 5.1 of Tru64
Unix installed.  KCC is currently available for 5.0 and they are trying to
get access to a machine with 5.1 to do the port of KCC to 5.1.

 &gt; I don't have an account on chi, but I do have an account
 &gt; on the Compaq TeraScale machine at Pittsburgh Supercomputing
 &gt; Center.  It has the same Compaq Tru64 operating system, but
 &gt; I don't think they have KCC installed.  I should probably
 &gt; have a look at building Pooma 2 there using the Compaq compiler.
 &gt; I might be able to help Lee with Pooma 1 issues, but it would
 &gt; make more sense to get an account on your chi machine first.

 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt;I agree that the numbers I reported imply something strange going on with our 
 &gt; &gt;SGI machine/compilers.  I thought it was strange enough that it should be
 &gt; &gt;reported to pooma-dev in case you guys had some insight into the problem that 
 &gt; &gt;I was missing.  I'm not really looking for a platform specific solution from
 &gt; &gt;you guys.  Actually, my data indicates a temporary work around for the SGI is 
 &gt; &gt;to just break up my files into much smaller files since the SGI C compiler
 &gt; &gt;seems to scale more like quadratic with the size of the .int.c files.  Of
 &gt; &gt;course I already have what I thought might be reasonable granularity there.
 &gt; &gt;The instantiation requests for the Pooma 2 assign functions are currently
 &gt; &gt;spread over 20 files.  I probably need to talk to someone from SGI about this 
 &gt; &gt;data and see if they know what is going on as well.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt;I think that the SGI platform will be an important platform for our October 1 
 &gt; &gt;deadline.  To my knowledge, Lee Ankeny has not been successful yet getting
 &gt; &gt;any of our Pooma 1 based code compiling on the Compaq machines.  Perhaps that 
 &gt; &gt;will change with the recent release of KCC-4.0e for Tru64 Unix 5.0.  BTW, do
 &gt; &gt;you guys have accounts on the chi machine - an open Compaq machine?  I was
 &gt; &gt;under the impression that you were supposed to have accounts there now.  I'm
 &gt; &gt;worried about what compile times are going to be like on the Compaq as well.
 &gt; &gt;I don't know enough about the machine yet but I wonder if our parallel builds 
 &gt; &gt;will be limited to 4 processors.
