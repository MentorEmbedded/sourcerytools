Dave,

As a general principle, we can agree that circular dependencies are bad. 
Field is using auxiliary templates that need information from Field. 
This problem can be worked around nicely in non-templated C++ code, but 
it is difficult to work through with templates. However, maybe, by 
re-factoring, this can be fixed. In particular, AltView1 doesn't use 
that much of Field. I will give this a shot.

Scott
