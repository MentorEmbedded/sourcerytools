I'm hazy about the R1 options, but isn't it --commlib? Also, I don't
recall whether it is mandatory to give the number of processes with
--processes NP. It may be redundant since you specified the -np for
mpirun, but I'm not sure.

Is the problem and a solution obvious?

Pooma r1 was configured with './conf SGI64 KAI OPTIMIZE MPI'.
