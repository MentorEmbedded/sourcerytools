<smaller>I do have a problem with it. If I make a change in the
ordering in the class I have to remember to reorder the initializers
in all of the constructors. That can be a major pain in the ass.

I said I didn't have a problem with Jeffrey fiddling with the order. I
agree that <bold>having</bold> to fiddle with the order is a problem.
Happily, we have some GCC developers with write permissions to the CVS

<smaller>Like Jim, I do have a problem with adding base default base
class

initializers. I thought the compiler was supposed to do this
implicitly.

Is this a stylistic change or a GCC-required change or is this required

by the standard?</smaller>
