Hi Dave,


The data in fields is not necessarily continuous. We allocate based on
a vertex-centered domain for all subfields. This is done so that when
the field is partitioned, all of the subfields will be aligned. This
fixes the nasty problems we had in R1 with slightly different sized
fields giving dramatically different partitionings. This improves
robustness and should improve performance. Note as well that if you
are looking at a patch and there are internal guard layers, the data
won't be continuous either. 


Your best bet is to assign the patch data to a brick-array of the
correct size. This will make the data continuous. However, it would be
helpful to see a snippet showing exactly what you're trying to do.
This would also help with respect to the size question - I am
surprised by the behavior you're reporting.

<excerpt><smaller>Hi Guys,

 

I talked to Jim about interfacing to some fortran linear solver code
awhile back and then before I left for

vacation, John and I did some work to try and write the interface for
our application using Pooma 2 so

we could use this fortran linear solver package.  One of the things I
am trying to do is to query a Pooma 2

Field and find out the size of the data that is local to a processor. 
I've done this query for the domain object

for a Field and for a cell centered field, it reports sizes in each
dimension or coordinate that are one more

than they should be.  John told me that you guys had decided to
allocate enough space for a vertex centered

field even if the field was cell centered - as an optimization of some
sort.  I am worried that the data for a

cell centered field may not be contiguous because of the extra padding
that occurs for cell centered fields

and because the domain object thinks it's size in each dimension is
one larger.  Can you tell me if the data

for a cell centered field that is local to a processor with one patch
per processor is actually contiguous in

memory?  I can test this experimentally but I have not had a chance to
do this yet.  Also, can you tell me the

recommended way to get the correct size of my data on a local
processor for a cell centered Pooma 2

Field?
