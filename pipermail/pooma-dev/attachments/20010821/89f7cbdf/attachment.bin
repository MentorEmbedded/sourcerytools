Thanks Stephen,


One critical aspect of "making things run fast" is making sure that
things run correctly in parallel, across multiple SMPs, using MPI. Our
plan needs to include this and this work should be front-loaded
because it is very important to Blanca for their 10/1 milestone.

The optimization work should probably contain a mix of work

on larger applications as well as examining benchmarks.</smaller></fontfamily>
