I personally have not thought about unstructured Fields.  Perhaps a
one-dimensional index scheme to number regions even for a
multi-dimensional might work.

</I>
As you point out, dimensions are template parameters.  Since the
dimension is known at compile-time, only member functions related to
these parameters need be present in the executable.  Also, this
decision need not be made at run-time.  For example, it could be known
that only two-dimensional read operators are needed.

One can avoid this restriction by writing a set of functions, each
creating containers of a particular dimension.  All other functions
will have templates to handle arbitrary dimensions.  At run-time, a
comamnd-line option can determine which function will be invoked.  Of
course, space requirements would be larger than if the dimension was
known at compile time.

Thanks,
