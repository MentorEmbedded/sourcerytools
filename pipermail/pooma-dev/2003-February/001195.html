<PRE>The following patch will introduce a structure for grouping source files.
The result will look like the modules page you can find here:

<A HREF="http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~rguenth/pooma/reference/modules.html">http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~rguenth/pooma/reference/modules.html</A>

I include below the summaries of the groups for which I added one.

/**
 * @defgroup Domain Domain Objects and Modifiers
 * @ingroup Structuring
 * These are classes which handle specifying a domain and modifying it.
 *
 * The types of domains can be divided into two classes, namely integer
 * domains and continuous domains.
 *
 * Integer domains include
 * - int
 * - Loc&lt;Dim&gt;
 * - Interval&lt;Dim&gt;
 * - Range&lt;Dim&gt;
 * - Grid&lt;Dim&gt;
 *
 * The only continuous domain class is Region&lt;Dim&gt;. There are a few special
 * domain classes, namely NullDomain, AllDomain and ErrorDomain.
 *
 * All domain classes come with their corresponding traits class
 * DomainTraits&lt;class&gt; which is used to manage operations on domains
 * such as
 * - splitting domains with the split function
 * - querying if domains overlap using the touches function
 * - querying the intersection of two domains using the intersect function
 * - growing/shrinking Interval&lt;Dim&gt; using the shrinkRight, growRight,
 *   shrinkLeft and growLeft functions
 * - finding the equivalent subset for a domain from a given transformation
 *   using the equivSubset function
 * - remove the overlap between two Interval&lt;Dim&gt; and return a vector of the
 *   resulting domain using the DomainRemoveOverlap function
 * - querying if one domain contains another using the contains function
 *
 * Domains can be modified by arithmetic operations and new domains can
 * be constructed using the helper classes in NewDomain.h and the LeftDomain
 * and RightDomain wildcard classes.
 *
 * You can iterate through domains by FIXME.
 *
 * Some domains can be sliced FIXME.

/**
 * @defgroup Engine Engines
 * @ingroup Objects
 *
 * Engine related classes/files.
 *
 * Engines provide the storage for Arrays and Fields and handle
 * domain decomposition, taking subviews and accessing components
 * transparently by providing a common interface to their users.
 *
 * Engine are usually defined recursively. Engines categorize into
 * engines allocating storage for data, engines that provide access
 * to computed data and engines providing modified access to other
 * engines.
 *
 * For the first category, the storage engines, the following are
 * evailable:
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, Brick &gt;
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, CompressibleBrick &gt;
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, Dynamic &gt;
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, ConstantFunction &gt;
 *
 * For the second category, the computation engines, the following
 * are available:
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, IndexFunction &lt; Functor &gt; &gt;
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, StencilEngine &lt; Function, Expression &gt; &gt;
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, UserFunctionEngine &lt; UserFunction, Expression &gt; &gt;
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, ExpressionTag &lt; Expr &gt; &gt;
 *
 * For the second category the most important engine types include:
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, Remote &lt; Tag &gt; &gt;
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, MultiPatch &lt; LayoutTag, PatchTag &gt; &gt;
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, CompFwd &lt; Eng, N &gt; &gt;
 *  - Engine &lt; Dim, T, IndirectionTag &lt; A1, A2 &gt; &gt;
 *  - Engines of the category
 *    Engine &lt; Dim, T, ViewEngineType &gt;, where
 *    ViewEngineType is one of
 *    BrickView,
 *    MultiPatchView&lt;LayoutTag, PatchTag, Dim&gt;,
 *    DynamicView
 *    and ViewEngine&lt;OriginalDim, ViewedEngineTag&gt;
 *
 * Views of Engines can be constructed by using the NewEngine&lt;&gt; traits
 * class which takes the to be viewed engine type and the subsetting
 * domain type as template parameters. NewEngine&lt;&gt; then defines the type
 * of the ViewEngine as Type_t typedef member.
 *
 * FIXME: Introduce NewEngineEngine&lt;&gt;, NewEngineDomain&lt;&gt; and
 * newEngineEngine() and newEngineDomain() with their concepts.

/**
 * @defgroup Evaluator
 * @ingroup Objects
 *
 * The evaluators present different ways to operate on Arrays and Fields.
 *
 * This includes fortran-like manual looping over the patches of the
 * data using the PatchFunction&lt;&gt; mechanism which supports multiple
 * input data but only one output. (PatchFunction.h, PatchKernel.h)
 *
 * Another way to operate is using the ScalarCode&lt;&gt; facility which
 * presents something like a n-argument stencil operation with some
 * of the arguments being the output. (ScalarCode.h, ScalarCodeInfo.h,
 * MultiArgKernel.h, MultiArgEvaluator.h)
 *
 * Evaluating a functor at a whole domain is done using the LoopApplyEvaluator.
 * (LoopApply.h)
 *
 * The most simple way is to use POOMA expressions who are evaluated
 * via ExpressioKernel objects. (ExpressionKernel.h)
 *
 * The internal evaluator objects are templated on the patch type which
 * gets constructed from the expression node types using the
 * EvaluatorCombine&lt;&gt; traits class and produce the tags
 * RemoteMultiPatchEvaluatorTag, MultiPatchEvaluatorTag, RemoteSinglePatchEvaluatorTag
 * and SinglePatchEvaluatorTag. The MainEvaluatorTag specialized class is
 * the root of any evaluation.
 *

/**
 * @defgroup Field Fields
 * @ingroup Objects
 *
 * Field related classes/files. Important classes include Field, FieldEngine
 * Centering and CanonicalCentering.
 *
 */

/**
 * @defgroup Mesh Field Meshes
 * @ingroup Field
 *
 * Meshes provide a way to attach coordinate information to the
 * vertices of a grid. You can choose between different mesh types
 * which constrain positions in a different way. All available meshes
 * are rectilinear, i.e. are constructed as outer product of spacing
 * vectors.
 *
 * To query a mesh for its positions or similar properties use the
 * functions positions(), outwardNormals(), coordinateNormals(), cellVolumes(),
 * faceAreas() and edgeLengths().
 *
 * Predefined mesh types are:
 *  - UniformRectilinearMesh which defines a uniformly spaced rectilinear mesh,
 *  - RectilinearMesh which defines a arbitrarily spaced rectilinear mesh,
 *  - NoMesh which defines a mesh without a mesh.
 *
 * Meshes are completed by one of Cartesian, Cylindrical or Spherical
 * coordinate system classes. Complete types for mesh can be constructed
 * using the MeshTraits traits class and the appropriate tag classes for
 * the mesh type and the coordinate system type.
 *
 */

/**
 * @defgroup DiffOps
 * @ingroup Field
 *
 */

/**
 * @defgroup Relations Field Relations
 * @ingroup Field
 *
 * Relations are FIXME.
 *
 * Usable predefined relations include boundary conditions of which
 * the following are available:
 *  - ConstantFaceBC
 *  - PeriodicFaceBC
 *  - PosReflectFaceBC
 *
 */

/**
 * @defgroup Layout Layouts - Laying out Domains
 * @ingroup Structuring
 *
 * A layout combines domain information and guard cell (both internal
 * and external) information and maps the domain to a specified partition.
 * So related topics are the \ref Domain and \ref Partition groups.
 *
 * All layouts operate with domains based on Interval&lt;Dim&gt;, i.e. a
 * continuous integer domain. This domain gets distributed/tiled in a
 * different way for different layout classes, namely
 * - DomainLayout does not tile/distribute the domain, hence it is applicable
 *   for local computation only
 * - GridLayout tiles/distributes the Dim-dimensional domain by constructing
 *   a (possibly) non-uniform rectilinear grid of subdomains (GridTag)
 * - UniformGridLayout tiles/distributes the domain using a uniform rectilinear
 *   grid of subdomains (UniformTag)
 * - SparseTileLayout tiles/distributes the domain using non-overlapping
 *   subdomains that need not cover the whole domain (SparseTileTag)
 * - DynamicLayout tiles/distributes the domain using a grid partition and
 *   handles dynamic domains such as coming from DynamicArray (DynamicTag)
 *
 * For actually using any of the above layout on a MultiPatch engine you need
 * to specify appropriate grid tags which are one of those specified above
 * alongst the layout classes.
 *
 * Specifying the actual tiling is done by several constructors dealing with
 * the most important tiling types. The generic way to specify tiling is to
 * use a partitioner, see \ref Partition for reference.
 *
 * Mapping the domain to the tiling can be done in two different ways,
 * namely distributed and replicated which is specified using an instance
 * of the DistributedTag and ReplicatedTag classes to the layout constructors.
 * Distributed means the domain is distributed over the tiling, replicated
 * means the entire domain is replicated over the tiling. Note that remote
 * engines do not make sense in conjunction with replicated layouts, and this
 * will trigger a runtime error.
 *
 */

/**
 * @defgroup Objects Data object and container classes
 * Objects for storing data and for doing computation with.
 *
 * Note that for complex objects like Fields and Arrays placed inside
 * structures the compiler will generate default copy constructors and
 * assignment operators that usually violate the principle of least
 * surprise in that they will invoke the objects assignment operator
 * which will cause a PETE expression to be evalutated and this may
 * lead to cryptic compiler error messages for for example IndexFunction
 * engine objects. To work around this you need to explicitly provide
 * copy constructors and assignment operators that use obj.initialize()
 * instead of an assignment. This will catch you if you are using
 * IndexFunction like objects, such as Stencils and FieldStencils. For
 * writable objects be prepared to get assertion failures because of
 * unitialized objects created by a default constructors are later
 * initialized by default copy/assignment.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup Partition Partitioning Domains
 * @ingroup Structuring
 *
 * These files deal with domain partitioning and mapping the partition
 * to computation nodes. The following partitioners are available:
 * - GridPartition
 * - UniformGridPartition
 * - TilePartition
 *
 * You usually dont need to interact with the mappers, which are
 * LocalMapper, ContextMapper, BisectionMapper, ContiguousMapper,
 * DistributedMapper and UniformMapper. They deal with mapping patches
 * to nodes, where LocalMapper is used for ReplicatedTag tagged layouts
 * and the others, derived from the base ContextMapper, for DistributedTag
 * tagged layouts.
