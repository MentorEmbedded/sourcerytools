Subject: Is pooma supported on gcc-3.4?
Message-ID: <415DAB42.4070808@us.ibm.com>

I downloaded pooma-2.4.0 (from downloads) and older 2.3.0 (available over on gcc testing).  Neither seem to work with gcc-3.4. 

Minimally, I see a __GLIBCPP__ check in the pooma sources that would cause it not to compile as that macro was renamed in gcc-3.4 timeframe (however, your CVS sources seem to have fixed via some autoconf checks).  

In general, just curious on whether pooma is normally considered supported for gcc-3.4, or is it limited to particular versions/architectures of GCC only?

P.S.
I was walking through your back threads at http://www.codesourcery.com/archives/pooma-dev/threads.html
and noticed that Zope errors out on about the third hit to 'Next Page' 	(
(e.g. http://www.codesourcery.com/archives/pooma-dev/thrd4.html)

For gcc 3.4 you will need the CVS version that fixes several ISO 
conformance bugs.  We were about to releasing an updated Pooma some 
weeks ago, but there's no progress - Jeffrey, what's the status on the 
2.4.1 release?

Hi,

I am using r2 CVS with Linux 32-bit Intel g++ 3.4.1 as well as Linux 
64-bit Opteron g++ 3.3.4 together with cheetah 1.1.4 & CVS and LAM 7.0.4.

I encounter crashes of r2/src/Particles/tests/bctest3 when running with 
more than 10 contexts:

The problem seems to stem from the sync() call, some PatchFunction might 
have a problem.

This is no wonder:

   if (Pooma::context() == 0)
     P.create(10,0,false);
   P.sync(P.a1);

i.e. we create 10 particles - distributing over 11 contexts isn't going 
to work.  We don't handle contexts with zero particles gracefully.  I 
think there are similar problems with #patches < #contexts.  But I'd 
qualify these cases as user error.

Hope this helps,
Richard.

Unfortunately, that's not the problem. It still doesn't work after 
creating 11 or more particles.

I've been using position-dependent distribution of particles for months 
now in my own code, often with many contexts not containing any 
particles. The problem only arises when the number of contexts is 
getting too high (mostly 8-10 being the limit). However, I have no idea 
what triggers the error...

Hm ok, that was just a guess.

I don't have time at the moment to dig into this myself, maybe you can 
try to debug this yourself - usually doing printf-debugging is the only 
way to debug these parallel failures though (unless you have expensive 
tools around, which I don't have).

okay, this patch fixes the UniformLayout particle swapping, and 
particularly the bctest3 particle test.

There was a floating point exception triggered as soon as less particles 
were created than patches existed -> sizePerPatch=0.
A there was an assertion error when the particle was being sent to a 
patch that didn't even exist (npid >= patchesGlobal()).

Yes, that looks ok.  SpatialLayout doesn't seem to need a similar fix. 
Jeffrey, may I approve (and apply) such patches from Arno?

Thanks for tracking this down and fixing it,

The Compiler should be able to vectorize the expression template expanders
(it isn't due to missing inlining and aliasing optimizations).  Manually
providing SIMD support would be a tedious task - you'd need to specialize
f.i. KernelEvaluator<InlineKernelTag>::evaluate() for different
operations(!), dimensionality and of course types.

Best leave it to compiler improvements.  I'll hope gcc 4.1 with
patches will get there, no hope for Intel.

Hi!

Pooma currently supports the packages mentioned in the subject, but I
can't find information on them (like license and possibilities to
download) anymore.  The only one with (some) information is
http://www.ccs.lanl.gov/ccs1/projects/Viz/pr-lux.html

Also does anyone know if PETE is still developed / officially hosted
somewhere?  Likewise for SMARTS?

Thanks for any information,
