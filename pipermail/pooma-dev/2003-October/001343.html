&gt;<i> Well - its easy to implement them, but probably a lot harder to get them
</I>&gt;<i> working at acceptable speed. Also doing f.i. vector x matrix with Array&lt;1&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> and Array&lt;2&gt; is not supported by any data-parallel operation I know of.
</I>
Exactly - unless the matrix is sparse, the last thing you generally want to
do on massively parallel machine is a matrix-vector product. 


&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Is there any work being done to bring SMARTS up to speed? For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parallell execution I'd like to try running on a MOSIX cluster, using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SMARTS to do the threading, but the current SMARTS in CVS fails to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compile the same way it did when I tried it briefly last year (there's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some conflict with pthreads)
</I>
&gt;<i> Still the same - I have some work on OpenMP support in my queue (but need
</I>&gt;<i> to finalize reduction support) that will perhaps make SMARTS unnecessary.
</I>&gt;<i> I myself use cheetah for MPI parallelization on a workstation cluster.
</I>
The real advantage of SMARTS was its data-flow ability, which is not
something OpenMP will recover (unless OpenMP has some magic that it didn't
have when I last looked). That said, SMARTS is pretty complex and its
light-weight threads are very machine-dependent -- it was still pre-beta
software on anything except the SGIs when the development ended. I think it
would make a great research project, but I wouldn't push it as part of
production POOMA.
