</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently in the process of evaluating POOMA for use in our software

</I>&gt;<i>

I would look elsewhere, f.i. at the PETSc library for this sort of use.
I'm at the moment looking at using PETSc for solving of (ono-)linear
systems while doing explicit stuff in POOMA. Stay tuned for some adaptor
classes.

&gt;<i> looking elsewhere, like the Blitz++ library, and do the parallelization

</I>&gt;<i> etc. Am I not looking in the right place? I'll also need basic matrix
</I>&gt;<i> decompositions like LDU, QR and LDU which brings me to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. How hard is it to implement new algorithms for the POOMA containers?
</I>&gt;<i> Even though I'm very confident with template code (including expression
</I>&gt;<i> templates), I must say that at this point the POOMA code has me more or
</I>&gt;<i> less baffled.
</I>
Well - its easy to implement them, but probably a lot harder to get them
working at acceptable speed. Also doing f.i. vector x matrix with Array&lt;1&gt;
and Array&lt;2&gt; is not supported by any data-parallel operation I know of.

&gt;<i> 3. Is there any work being done to bring SMARTS up to speed? For
</I>&gt;<i> parallell execution I'd like to try running on a MOSIX cluster, using
</I>&gt;<i> SMARTS to do the threading, but the current SMARTS in CVS fails to
</I>&gt;<i> compile the same way it did when I tried it briefly last year (there's
</I>&gt;<i> some conflict with pthreads)
</I>
Still the same - I have some work on OpenMP support in my queue (but need
to finalize reduction support) that will perhaps make SMARTS unnecessary.
I myself use cheetah for MPI parallelization on a workstation cluster.

&gt;<i> 4. About licensing: While POOMA is currently free for commercial use,
</I>&gt;<i> are there any plans to make it a commercial package down the road? Not
</I>&gt;<i> that we mind paying for software, but I'm a bit reluctant to start using
</I>&gt;<i> something which may suddenly end up becoming an expensive vendor
</I>&gt;<i> lock-in.
</I>
At least all &quot;old&quot; versions would stay open, and I suspect in the above
case I would start a fork for further open POOMA development. It would be
interesting to know if the future ongoing work (which was announced here a
few weeks ago) is done in public or closed as contract work.

&gt;<i> Also, does/will CodeSourcery offer commercial support for
</I>&gt;<i> POOMA, something like you currently offer for gcc?
</I>
They state that from their website, so... - but I dont know.

Hope this clarifies something,

 Richard.
