Yeah, I thought of this as well, but it's too complicated.  I merely 
guess treating the guard updates as regular iterates (and exposing this 
fact too early - before data-flow analysis) is the main problem ...

&gt;<i> We also discussed aggregating all of the guard updates for a single

</I>&gt;<i> iterates and the overhead can kill you. This may be more along the lines

</I>
... which the above would support.  And these single iterates indeed 
prevent you from implementing efficient guard communication schemes.

&gt;<i> I personally don't like the idea of putting anything to do with guards, 
</I>&gt;<i> dirty-ness, etc in BrickEngine. It is a clean abstraction. If you need 
</I>&gt;<i> an enhanced abstraction for MultiPatchEngine to work with, then I'd

</I>
Ok, first I thought on tackling external guards at the same time - and 
obviously BrickEngine may have external guards, so it fitted naturally.
Also dirtying a patch-view of a MultiPatchEngine would work the right 
way then (I suppose it doesn't right now - but need to check).

But yes, it should be even possible to leave it in MultiPatchEngine.
