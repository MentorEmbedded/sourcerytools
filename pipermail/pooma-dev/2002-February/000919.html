<PRE>Well:
I have the demo project passing all of the regression tests using the 
head version of Pooma through the PhysicsSupport layer. This was a 
considerable effort, but, things are looking pretty good.

While I was at it, I started with a virgin version of the Pooma Head 
version and found the following 3 problems which everyone must fix 
before we can use the Head version. If these are innocuous enough I 
would like to have them checked in, otherwise, our team will have to 
remember to change them every time we check out from scratch.

The first problem keeps the relations from being sorted by priority 
when they are added. This has not really been tested, since I haven't 
used relation groups yet, but, it appears to be wrong since the test 
will never be true otherwise.

The second problem is a simple typo. Once it was fixed our regression 
tests passed, the Pooma tests never tested this case.

The third set of changes is to make a common interface between 
&quot;DomainLayout&quot; and the other distributed layouts so that one code 
base compiles in both serial and distributed cases. The beginGlobal 
function is being called from the IO stuff Jim wrote. Everything 
seems to work with these changes, but, someone with a clearer overall 
picture should probably check it out. I just copied the &quot;local&quot; 
section and replaced &quot;Local&quot; with &quot;Global&quot;.

I hope to have everything moved over to the head version by the end 
of next week. Then we have another effort to finish the physics that 
was not quite done by the end of the &quot;Demo Project&quot;. I continue to 
believe that there is a need for this work and I intend to put it 
into reasonable shape so that I can get a group of users and 
re-establish support for what we were doing.

I hope that all of you are doing well and that you will remember us 
when &quot;Numerics/Proximation&quot; and CodeSourcery make you all rich and 
famous. Maybe those of us at the lab can become &quot;your people&quot; so that 
your other rich and famous friends will have someone to call when you 
say &quot;Have your people call my people&quot;.

Anyhow, back to the grind. Don't forget, its Valentine's day, so you 
better have something by the time you go home.

John Hall
