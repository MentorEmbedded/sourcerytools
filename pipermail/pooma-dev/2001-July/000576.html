<PRE>I finally have a design for a POOMA relations package that I like and 
have implemented it and started to perform some testing.

To bring people up to speed, the idea, originally developed by the 
Blanca team, is as follows. A very common pattern in theoretical physics 
is illustrated by the simple example.

The total energy E is defined

   E = K + U

where

   K = m v^2 / 2

is the kinetic energy and

   U = m g h

is the potential energy and

   v = p / m

where p is the momentum. E, K, U, and v are dependent variables while p 
and m are independent variables (g is a constant).

Supporting this pattern is a good thing (tm) since it allows our users 
to more easily model their calculations using POOMA. However, there is 
an additional benefit in that this pattern gives us (POOMA developers) 
access to the global structure of the computation. This means that we 
know the data dependencies: for example, if p changes, we need to 
re-compute v and then K (but not U)  to get a correct E. This, in turn, 
allows us to ensure correctness. Also, in principle, we could perform 
optimizations on the tree to improve performance. We could even cache 
information learned from early timesteps to improve performance as the 
simulation progresses.

POOMA 2 has had a rudimentary implementation of this pattern since the 
start, primarily to support boundary conditions, which took the form

   F = f(F)

where F is a field and f is some function of the field's values. This 
expression was encapsulated inside an object called an &quot;Updater&quot;. 
Moreover, each Field contains a list of these updater objects. All 
updaters have an attribute called a &quot;dirty&quot; flag. The dirty flag for all 
of the updates associated with F is set whenever F is written to. 
However, it is important to realize that the expression encapsulated by 
the updater is not run until someone wants to read from F AND the 
updater's dirty flag is set.

The Blanca team cleverly realized that this concept can be extended to 
more complicated situations. For example,

F = f(F, L1, L2)

There is one important difference with the previous case: whenever the 
fields L1 or L2 become dirty, F must become dirty.

Blanca has implemented an external version of this facility, but it has 
been clear to me for a long time that this is more properly handled 
inside of POOMA, both for ease of implementation and to gain the full 
benefits. I have struggled with the architecture for a while, but I now 
have a unified design that encompasses the old boundary condition 
support and the newer relation pattern. This new facility will replace 
the code the current Updater directory. Since it is a broader 
abstraction, the new facility is called the &quot;Relations&quot; package. This is 
also the name originally used by Blanca.

Relations can be packaged in functor objects or in regular or member 
functions. From our simple example above, these would look like:

// Functor

class ComputeKineticEnergy
public:

   ComputeKineticEnergy(const ComputeKineticEnergy &amp;, const Field_t &amp;) { }

   void operator()(const Field_t &amp;K, const Field_t &amp;m, const Field_t &amp;v)
   {
     K = m * v * v / 2;
   }
};

// Function

void computePotentialEnergy(const Field_t &amp;U, const Field &amp;m, const 
Field &amp;h)
{
   U = m * g * h;
}

// Member function

struct ComputeVelocity
{
   void doit(const Field_t &amp;v, const Field_t &amp;p, const Field_t &amp;m)
   {
     v = p /  m;
   }
};

Functors are primarily useful when the calculation depends on cached 
data. This is the case with many of the boundary conditions, which 
pre-compute domain information. The constructor shown is required to 
allow, in principle, initialization of this auxiliary data.

These relations are added to the appropriate fields using the statements

   Pooma::newRelationFunctor(ComputeKineticEnergy(), K, m, v);
   Pooma::newRelationFunctionPtr(computePotentialEnergy, U, m, h);
   Pooma::newRelationMemberPtr(obj, &amp;ComputeVelocity::doit, v, p, m);

Then, the entire calculation is triggered by

   E = K + U;

If we then change p and write

   E.applyRelations();

v, K, and E will be automatically updated.

All of this is working in simple cases. However, there are some subtle 
issues associated with handling arrays, stencils, and sub-fields that 
need to be worked out as well as the painful, but simple, work of 
supporting relations with up to 6 things on the RHS.
