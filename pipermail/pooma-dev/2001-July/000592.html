<PRE>Hi Dave,

The data in fields is not necessarily continuous. We allocate based on a 
vertex-centered domain for all subfields. This is done so that when the 
field is partitioned, all of the subfields will be aligned. This fixes 
the nasty problems we had in R1 with slightly different sized fields 
giving dramatically different partitionings. This improves robustness 
and should improve performance. Note as well that if you are looking at 
a patch and there are internal guard layers, the data won't be 
continuous either.

Your best bet is to assign the patch data to a brick-array of the 
correct size. This will make the data continuous. However, it would be 
helpful to see a snippet showing exactly what you're trying to do. This 
would also help with respect to the size question - I am surprised by 
the behavior you're reporting.
