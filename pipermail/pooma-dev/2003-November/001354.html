Ok, I'll have another look into Tensor.h then and figure out if the
template metaprogams can do any magic a simple loop implementation cannot
do. If not, I'm going to scrap the metaprograms in favor of simple loops.
Like

 TensorAssign&lt;TensorEngine&lt;Dim, T, Tag&gt;, TensorEngine&lt;Dim, T2, Tag&gt;, Op &gt;
  ::apply(T1&amp; t1, T2&amp; t2, Op&amp; op) {
    for (int i=0; i&lt;TensorStorageSize&lt;Dim, Tag&gt;::size; ++i)
      op(t1(i), t2(i));
 }

for matching dimensions and engine tags.

&gt;<i> It does look like your changes make use of template template parameters.

</I>
I think they are widely supported now.  This also raises the question, if
we're going to require an ISO C++ conformant compiler for future releases,
which I would encourage.  Even MS is shipping one with .NET now.

Richard.
