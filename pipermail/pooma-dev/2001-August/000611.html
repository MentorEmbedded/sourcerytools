<PRE>timers and performance measurement under LinuxHi Jim,

It's probably a good idea to have an option for choosing between CPU time
and wallclock time as the benchmark measurement, since they each have
their own purpose.  Normally CPU time is interesting for measuring on-node
performance and wallclock time is more useful for measuring parallel
speedup.
As for threads, I think you can only measure CPU time while a thread is
active on a processor.  Doing anything else doesn't really make sense.  So
with clock(), you would want to call clock() when a thread first begins to
work
(not before the thread is actually launched!) and then call clock() again
when
the thread is done working (but before the thread exits).  If each thread
does
a tiny amount of work, the resolution issue you mentioned will be an issue.
The clock() function has different resolutions on different architectures.
But
normally the variation in performance measurement from one run to the next
is far greater than the timer resolution anyway.

The gettimeofday() function is probably the best thing to use for wallclock
time measurement.  This is what we used in the old Timer class in Pooma r1.
I haven't looked at your check-in yet, but hopefully you remembered to check
for overflow in the microseconds counter and increment the seconds counter
accordingly.  Other than that, I remember that code as being pretty simple.

As for your comments on the PIII performance, I think what you are seeing
is correct.  The out-of-cache performance is not very good.  You will see
closer to optimal performance only when the problem size is in-cache, and
the caches are much smaller than what we were used to on the SGI boxes.
With an optimized C code kernel, you should be able to see the cache effect
and stronger flops numbers for small problem sizes.  (But of course, it gets
harder to measure accurately, too.)  I'm not aware of any profiling tools
from
KAI, so I think prof/gprof is all there is, unless you know how to access
Pentium
hardware counters.  Quite a while ago, I fooled around with the performance
analysis tools that come with Intel VTune.  They were not terribly helpful,
other
than telling me the obvious, that all the time was being spent in the kernel
loop.
The real problem is that the optimization and inlining of the compiler were
poor
enough that there was little to do to improve performance.  I remember being
surprised to find that Blitz code optimized much better under VTune than
Pooma
code.  I think the reasons had to do with the amount of template complexity
in Pooma versus Blitz.  Maybe things are better under newer versions of
VTune,
but Allan didn't seem too impressed with the newest VTune when I asked him
about it.  In any case, I sort of thought that VTune was not an important
target
for Pooma and its customers, so I haven't pursued it further.

  Subject: [pooma-dev] timers and performance measurement under Linux


  How important is it that the timer used by the benchmark class measure CPU
time? I'm not sure how we've even been using this class for parallel codes -
in fact, I was thinking that back when we were just testing with threads, we
were measuring wall-clock time. But the default implementation of
Utilities/Clock.h uses the &quot;clock()&quot; call, which is supposed to measure
&quot;elapsed processor time&quot;, though I'm not completely sure what that means for
a multithreaded program on a multi-processor. On the SGI we were using the
high-performance timers, which I believe access the CPUs hardware
performance registers, so I would think that that was CPU time as well.
Anyway, the problem is that clock() only has 10 ms granularity under Linux
and that's really crappy if you're trying to measure scaling with problem
size. I've written a version that uses gettimeofday, which has a granularity
of something like 15 microseconds under Linux (may depend on processor
speed?), but this is definitely not a measure of CPU time. For serial
programs this just means that you need to test on an unloaded machine to
have the results make sense. For parallel programs, this means that you need
to interpret the results differently. Anyway, I'm using this and it seems
generally useful, so I'd like to check it in, but was wondering if the
clock-time versus CPU-time measurement was a problem for anyone. I suppose
we could put an accessor on Clock that would allow the user to find out what
type of time was being presented, and Benchmark could examine this and
calculate appropriately, if necessary.

  As a side comment, I'm using KCC on one of our 1 GHz PIII Linux boxes.
ABCTest (which is doing a simple non-stencil calculation, so this is as fast
as it gets) is only getting 45 MFlops for the C version, which is the
fastest. This seems pretty pathetic. What have other Linux users seen on
what types of boxes? Also, what is available on Linux for profiling? Is
prof/gprof it? Does KAI sell anything commercial? Does the PIII have any
hardware performance monitoring and is there access to it? Does VTune (under
Windows) inline sufficiently well to do performance testing there (allegedly
good profiling tools, so it might be OK for the serial stuff, but I don't
know if it is capable of &quot;inlining everything&quot;).

    Jim
