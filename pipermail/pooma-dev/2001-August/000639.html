<PRE>For what it is worth. I am at the point where I would try to prevent 
anyone from our project checking out a new Pooma until October 1st. 
Maybe at this point we should go on the branch and you guys should 
return to the head. Just let us know what the branch tag is and we 
will be set.
John

P.S. Is there a scheme you can come up with that would allow us to 
make some progress on making our setup code parallel? We are running 
short on time now and the biggest remaining problem is our inability 
to run in parallel due to little setup issues (and ensight dumps) 
that I haven't gotten around to fixing. The physics is almost 
complete and appears to be working spectacularly well (really, 
really, well). We can win this bet and give Pooma/Blanca new life if 
we run in parallel.

FWIW, Jeff Brown has allocated the money for your contract through 
next February. We are going to be evaluated then for its 
continuation. So rumors that the contract might disappear are 
unfounded.
