+RELEASE NOTES v2.4.1
+
+////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
+
+Version 2.4.1 cleans up the codebase to be ISO C++ conformant.  As
+such an ISO C++ conforming compiler and standard library is recommended,
+but still compilers close to that may be supported (gcc 3.3 and Intel 7.2
+are).
+
+Most visible enhancements in this release are the addition of native
+MPI support for message passing parallelism and OpenMP support for
+thread parallelism.  MPI support was tested with the MPICH and LAM MPI
+implementations, OpenMP support was tested with the Intel compiler
+on ia32 and ia64 architectures.  Message passing parallelism through
+using the Cheetah library is still supported.
+
+Numerous restrictions on the use of Arrays, Fields and expressions in
+certain constructs were lifted.  Also may bugs were fixed and performance
+was improved.
+
+The status of POOMA particles, especially parallel particles, is
+undetermined.  So is the status of thread parallelism based on the
+SMARTS library.
+
+Support libraries for POOMA such as Cheetah, SMARTS and PETE can be
+obtained from <A HREF="http://www.pooma.com/.">http://www.pooma.com/.</A>

 document and follow the steps.

 On Unix machines, POOMA can be compiled with one or more optional
 packages. The currently available optional packages are:

-	o SMARTS, for multithreaded parallelism and dataflow analysis
-
-	o PDT, for static analysis of source code
-
-	o TAU, for automatic source code profiling
-
-	o PAWS, for run-time coupling of parallel data structures with
-          other parallel programs.

 problems section at the end of this document.  Some combinations of packages

-               NOTES ON KNOWN PROBLEMS:
-               ------------------------
-
-Linux with RedHat 6 (and possibly other distributions):
--------------------------------------------------------
-We have observed an odd problem with gmake on RedHat 6 installations,
-where a target will be built successfully, but then gmake will attempt
-to build one more incorrectly specified target.  The latter should not
-happen, but does.  It will just print a strange error message and
-exit, but will not affect the target that was actually built
-properly.  If you see such behavior, add the '-r' flag to your 'gmake'
-commands, to turn off implicit build rules in GNU make.  This should
-prevent these errors from happening.
-
-KCC 3.4d compiler:
-------------------
-We have run across some compiler bugs triggered by our developer test
-codes.  These bugs have been reported but are not yet resolved.
-
-GCC compiler:
---------------
-Some codes may cause the GCC v2.95 compiler to exhaust virtual memory while
-compiling, leading to an error message from g++ such as &quot;Cannot allocate
-XXX bytes&quot;, where XXX is some number.  This is especially common when
-compiling with optimization turned on.  Two possible solutions are to
-turn down the level of optimization (by modifying the optimization settings
-in the appropriate .conf file) or to break the code up into smaller
-source code files.
-
-Using more recent versions of GCC (3.2 and up) is recommended and will fix
-this particular and many other problems. Note that GCC v3.0 and v3.1 generate
-wrong code under certain circumstances when using optimization. Use of them
-is not recommended.
-
-
-Using SMARTS:
--------------
-
-SMARTS places particular requirements on the thread-safety of the compilers
-used.  See the SMARTS documentation for details, but in some situations this
-may restrict your choice of build options.  (For example, with KCC 3.4g, the
-thread-safe version requires that exceptions be turned on.)
