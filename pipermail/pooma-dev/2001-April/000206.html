<PRE>RE: [pooma-dev] more on VC++ ide filesAllan will correct me if I am wrong,
but I think cygwin has
some weird problems with directory names that have spaces
in them.  So I avoid that completely within the cygwin realm
of my hard drive.

Another &quot;make&quot; problem under cygwin is the step where the
executable gets copied to a file with &quot;_$(PASS)&quot; appended to
the name.  It throws an error because it thinks the two arguments
to cp are the same.  I think the problem is that we do not have
the appropriate .exe filename extension included.  This could
be fixed by defining some symbol for the application filename
extension and adding that to the build system.  I will see what
I can do to fix this.

  I get an error when trying to do &quot;make&quot; that is apparently due to spaces
in the path names (&quot;Documents and Users&quot;...). Is there anything that can be
done to make this work, or do I just have to move the files into a path that
has no spaces (~/r2 or something).

  Julian,

  Now that you have identified the problem I'll find a solution that works
  under/with Cygwin over the next couple of days.

  On the subject of configure under Cygwin, I've been annoyed before by the
  absence of which.  I even found a toolkit claiming to offer a which
  replacement, but which was missing.  The GNU manuals at fsf.org do not
  include documentation for this utility either.  Hmm.  I just looked at my
  FreeBSD which and I discovered that it's a Perl script.  It's
  redistributable and it worked, so I've included it below.

  Under Cygwin bash the current directory is not a default part of the path.
  On my installation either &quot;perl configure&quot; or &quot;./configure&quot; works.

  Allan



  I copied the following FreeBSD which script into c:\cygwin\bin and it
works
  under Cygwin (but not under a normal WinNT CMD shell because it uses ':'
as
  the default path separator).
