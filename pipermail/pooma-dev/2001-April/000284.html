<PRE>RE: [pooma-dev] DynamicArray destroy methodsHi Jim,

I'm pretty sure your performance concerns are unfounded.
Accessing object methods via reference should never incur
a performance penalty, just as using the dot operator and
the arrow operator should be equivalent.  If this were not the
case, almost all C++ code ever written would have problems.
There is a performance penalty when you pass a heavyweight
object by value, of course.

In any case, I did a quick test of your idea.  It can be made
to work, but is slightly more annoying in actual use.  In order
for the pass-by-value to match when passing an iterator pair,
both of the arguments must be local objects that can be copied.
Thus, passing something like (dptr,dptr+3), where dptr is an
int*, once again triggers the ambiguity error.  The compiler thinks
you have passed an int* &amp; and an int*, and these two arguments
are not exactly the same.  So you have to declare a second
int* object and set it equal to dptr+3.  With const references,
this little annoyance is gone.

Julian C.

P.S.  I stumbled over another potential bug, this time in the
IteratorPairDomain class.  The non-const version of operator()
returns an Element_t&amp;.  This is incorrect when Iter is a const T*.
I think we need to add a typedef for ElementRef_t, which would
be set to std::iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::reference, and return that here.

  I tend not to like this idea. Won't passing references result in
dereferencing every time you use the object in question? With iterators and
ints I would think this could potentially impact performance.

  What about going the other way and passing the Destroy tag by value? We
might need to write a dummy copy constructor for the tag, but that's not so
hard.

  &gt;
  &gt; Never mind!  I just figured out the problem
  &gt; and the solution.  The reason for the overload
  &gt; ambiguities is that we were defining the
  &gt; destroy() functions to take domain and destroy
  &gt; method arguments by const reference but take
  &gt; iterators and patch IDs by value.  So the
  &gt; overloads did not match the function calls in
  &gt; exactly the same way, and I guess const int&amp; is
  &gt; preferred to int when you pass a literal int
  &gt; like &quot;6&quot;.  Also, you have to be careful about
  &gt; passing with an int array like killList because
  &gt; it is not treated quite the same as &amp;killList[0]
  &gt; when it comes to argument matching.
  &gt;
  &gt; Anyhow, once I changed the iterator and patchID
  &gt; arguments to be passed by const reference, all
  &gt; the function overloads matched as expected.  I'd
  &gt; like to check in these fixes to DynamicArray.h
  &gt; along with the minor fixes I mentioned in my
  &gt; original e-mail on this, barring any objections.
  &gt; I am attaching the diff's for DynamicArray.h
  &gt; Sorry for the volley of e-mails on this.

  &gt; &gt;
  &gt; &gt; One way out of the function overloading
  &gt; &gt; quandary I noted below would be to call
  &gt; &gt; out versions of destroy() for each of the
  &gt; &gt; two existing destroy methods, BackFill
  &gt; &gt; and ShiftUp, rather than use a template
  &gt; &gt; parameter.  We are unlikely to add more
  &gt; &gt; of these, and if we do, they have to be
  &gt; &gt; added to the list in DynamicEvents anyway.
  &gt; &gt; Should we take this approach?

  &gt; &gt; &gt;
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Jim,
  &gt; &gt; &gt;
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I was going to add new destroy() functions
  &gt; &gt; &gt; to Particles corresponding to the new
  &gt; &gt; &gt; IteratorPairDomain-based functions you
  &gt; &gt; &gt; added to DynamicArray.  I noticed three minor
  &gt; &gt; &gt; glitches in DynamicArray.h that I was going
  &gt; &gt; &gt; to fix, if you don't object.  One is on
  &gt; &gt; &gt; line 486.  We don't need to provide the
  &gt; &gt; &gt; BackFill() argument here because dynamic
  &gt; &gt; &gt; engines already provide a destroy() function
  &gt; &gt; &gt; that takes just a Domain argument.  (No harm
  &gt; &gt; &gt; done here though, and I think this glitch
  &gt; &gt; &gt; was here prior to your recent changes.)  The
  &gt; &gt; &gt; next item is on line 501.  You left out the
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Pooma:: qualifier on the IteratorPairDomain
  &gt; &gt; &gt; type.  It should be there for consistency,
  &gt; &gt; &gt; although there is probably a &quot;using namespace
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Pooma;&quot; statement somewhere that is making
  &gt; &gt; &gt; this work as written.  The last problem is on
  &gt; &gt; &gt; line 542.  I think you do have to provide the
  &gt; &gt; &gt; BackFill() argument here because MPEngine only
  &gt; &gt; &gt; provides three versions of destroy(): domain,
  &gt; &gt; &gt; domain and patchID, or domain, patchID and method.
  &gt; &gt; &gt;
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I was trying to check out this third item when
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I ran into another problem.  Perhaps others can
  &gt; &gt; &gt; chime in on this.  I modified dynamic_array_test5.cpp
  &gt; &gt; &gt; to call destroy() without specifying a method.  So
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I made calls with arguments (int*,int*) and with
  &gt; &gt; &gt; (vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator,vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator,int).
  &gt; &gt; &gt; The first call should invoke destroy() with Iter
  &gt; &gt; &gt; equal to int* (DynamicArray.h, line 498), but gcc
  &gt; &gt; &gt; says the overload is ambiguous with the version on
  &gt; &gt; &gt; line 477 also being plausible.  I thought matching
  &gt; &gt; &gt; one template parameter always beats matching two.
  &gt; &gt; &gt; With my second call, I was trying to invoke the
  &gt; &gt; &gt; destroy() function on line 538 of DynamicArray.h,
  &gt; &gt; &gt; but gcc thinks the version on line 491 is a good
  &gt; &gt; &gt; match also.  Again I am surprised because PatchID_t
  &gt; &gt; &gt; is defined as int, and that exactly matches the
  &gt; &gt; &gt; type of my third argument.  What's the deal?
  &gt; &gt; &gt;
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Julian C.
