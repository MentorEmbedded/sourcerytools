<PRE>Hi Jim,

I feel your pain with regard to the whole design of Domains.
However, you are overstating the difficulties here a fair bit.
You are correct that the main reason for the existence of
DomainTraits is to handle int's as a Domain.  We need that
capability for the Array interface.  As a result, it is sensible
to standardize the method of obtaining traits info by having
all Domains do this via a DomainTraits specialization.  I
don't think DomainTraits can or should be eliminated at
this point.  My only question was whether it was OK to
require that code pull these traits from DomainTraits, and
not assume that the traits info is duplicated in the Domain
class itself.  Obviously, not using DomainTraits fails if the
&quot;Domain&quot; is actually an int, but then again, the code may not
be expecting an int anyway.

There are not many changes required to existing code.  I found
a few spots in BrickBase.h, the MakeReturn functors for Array
and NewField, and some of the Evaluator classes where we
were extracting a trait from a Domain rather than DomainTraits.
I have already sent Jeffrey all the changes so he can double-check
me on that.  To address your comments about usability: the Domain
header files such as Interval.h already include the corresponding
DomainTraits.Interval.h header for the DomainTraits specialization.
So no new includes are required beyond what is already done.  The
DomainTraits.int.h file is sneakily included by Loc.h and/or Interval.h
as well, mainly because we define arithmetic interactions between
int and these two Domain types primarily.  I agree that this is crummy
physical design, but it is functional, and we are not likely to add further
DomainTraits specializations for other non-Domain types.

The main motivation here is not to clean up the design of Domains.
It is to avoid unnecessary duplication of static traits data in both Domains
and DomainTraits, given the necessary evil of a DomainTraits class.

-- Julian C.

P.S. This issue of a separate traits class doesn't apply to Layouts or Engines.
In those cases, I would like to convert the enums to static data members,
but we can just leave the data where it is.  I'll do those changes later.

</I>&gt;<i> Also, I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to include if I'm going to use the

</I>&gt;<i> although this seems like a physical design mistake to me. And what about our
</I>&gt;<i> friend &quot;int&quot; (the only reason to provide the indirection in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place). There is no &quot;int.h&quot; that includes &quot;DomainTraits.int.h&quot;, so that
</I>&gt;<i> specialization will not be there. So I do need to include
</I>&gt;<i> DomainTraits.int.h. What if someone tries using an int[] as a 1D domain? We
</I>&gt;<i> could probably make that work (if we can't, then DomainTraits really is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty worthless 8-). Etc...
