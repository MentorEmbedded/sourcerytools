ACK!

&gt;<i>From a usability standpoint, these should stay in the domains. I think we
</I>went way overboard in generalizing domains, and part of that is
DomainTraits.

Aside from &quot;int&quot;, we don't use any non-&quot;src/Domain&quot; classes as Domains, and
I suspect that most things that get a Domain really aren't expecting an int.
Thus we don't need the extra layer of indirection (which does have a cost in
both compile time and code complexity). Further, since we have Loc&lt;1&gt; for to
represent single points, we don't even need to provide the capability of
using Domains as ints. The main exception is in user interfaces where ints
are expected (Array::operator()).

Also, I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to include if I'm going to use the
DomainTraits class. Do I just include &quot;Domain/DomainTraits.h&quot; (which is just
the general template). Do I include every one? What if someone later adds
another?? Whoever instantiates our template will have included the
appropriate Domain header, and thus will have the appropriate DomainTraits
header, so maybe I only need the general template to get things to compile,
although this seems like a physical design mistake to me. And what about our
friend &quot;int&quot; (the only reason to provide the indirection in the first
place). There is no &quot;int.h&quot; that includes &quot;DomainTraits.int.h&quot;, so that
specialization will not be there. So I do need to include
DomainTraits.int.h. What if someone tries using an int[] as a 1D domain? We
could probably make that work (if we can't, then DomainTraits really is
pretty worthless 8-). Etc...

So...

I'd say changing enums to static const's in order to eliminate some compiler
warnings is cool. But I don't think we want to start cleaning up the Domain
design unless we're ready to jump in whole hog and basically do

  % rm -rf Domain

and make a fresh start.
