<PRE>I wouldn't apply this without careful performance testing on a large-ish
problem using KCC (or some other compiler that really inlines everything
that it is told to inline and optimizes the hell out of the results). This
seems like a reasonable thing to do, but I worry about adding additional
code to the construction of expressions since they are constructed
recursively and it is expected that a lot of stuff that goes on in their
usage will be inlined away. Back in the day we ran into a number of cases
where it was easy to push the optimizer over the edge and lose a lot of
performance with KCC and SGI CC (the only two compilers that, as far as I
know, have approached hand-coded loop speed for Pooma Array code, which is
THE goal.) This is most important in ExpressionEngines built out of
Brick-engines - i.e. the iterates that ultimately are created and evaluated
in evaluating a multipatch expression. If the loops over these expression
engines don't completely inline, and basically end up looking like what
you'd write by hand, you're hosed, from a performance perspective. Unless
things have changed dramatically, gcc 3 is not at the level of performance
to make this assessment. (Jeffrey, do you agree?)

Build and testing completed with no regressions in Engine, Array and Field
on ppc-linux with gcc 3.2.3

Ok to apply?

Thanks, Richard.
