<PRE>Hi Richard,

Wish you had been doing this a couple of years ago, when exponential decay
hadn't set in so firmly. :) 

I had been looking at similar ideas back in '99. I had considered adding a
Smarts DataObject for each face in order to allow independent face-to-face
dependency tracking (one would need to be careful with the corners here).
There were complications to the idea, though I'm afraid I can't recall what
they were. I still think this is probably the way to go - SMARTs uses these
objects to build a dependency graph and then evaluates that graph in some
&quot;smart&quot; order, hoping to reuse cache, etc. The prioritization algorithm was
something we had planned to play with some more. (There were also some ideas
about ways to produce fewer small iterates as these really kill you, and
guard filling makes a lot of these.)

If I have time in the next week or so (I'm taking a bit of a break over the
holidays), I'll see if I have my old email archive on one of my computers.
There may be some ideas in old email. I don't think these ever reached the
level of a white paper. 

There are some published papers on SMARTs. The only one I have on my shelf
is the Proceedings from ICS '99, p. 302. I'm sure there were some
SuperComputing 9x papers as well. 

Cheers,

	Jim

Ok, I convinced myself that the above should be the way to go.  But is it
possible at all?  At least one should be able to template it on the domain
type, so we can use AllDomain here for all requests we cannot (now) update
to the new mechanism.

How does SMARTS handle all its data analysis?

Thanks for any suggestions,

Richard.
