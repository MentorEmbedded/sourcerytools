I don't think having DataObjects for the faces would help (and it would
have a cost). You'd either have to introduce DataObjects for the corners,
too (that's 72 for the 4-dimensional case, already! don't even think about
higher dimensionalities), or have overlapping DataObjects which would
surely confuse the scheduler. Oh, but we have overlapping DataObjects
anyway with the guards (but I think we're just looking at the owned domain
here from the DataObject side of view, no?).

What I'll now try to do is introducing one extra flag to the dirty mask to
indicate, wether we have the corners updated.  For this to work
efficiently, we'd need to split the intersector expressionApply into two
phases, one collecting the data about the needed guards (including wether
we need any corners), and one doing the update. If we don't need the
corners, we can do completely independend updates, if we need them, we
have to be clever.

To teach the scheduler which iterates on the same DataObject are
independend, the way to go seems to be tracking of the affected domain for
each iterate/DataObject.  I haven't gone through the details, but it
should be possible to do this.  Of course, SMARTS would need to be updated
for this, but I'm not interested in SMARTS at all (just concentrating on
native OpenMP and MPI, and maybe hybrid operation).

But I for sure are happy for any input on this matter.

Richard.
