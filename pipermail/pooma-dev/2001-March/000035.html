Last Week
=========

Most of the effort was on setting up development infrastructure.
Mitchell moved the POOMA CVS repository from LANL to CodeSourcery.
Haney spent some time figuring out how to set up a Macintosh to
perform the check outs.  Stokes installed a variety of compilers in
order to begin testing some of POOMA code.

Oldham made a variety of minor improvements to POOMA aimed at
increasing its portability.

Stokes considered various approaches to documenting POOMA.

Mitchell approached Pete Beckman about obtaining the `pooma.com'
domain name from him.  Agreement was reached about transferring the
domain to CodeSourcery, but full transfer has not yet taken place.
Mitchell responded to NDA requests from LANL regarding the Compaq
hardware.

Next Week
=========

Development will begin in earnest, now that everyone is able to access
the code base, and now that Proximation has met an internal deadline
that took up a good bit of Crotinger's time last week.

Haney, Crotinger will begin implementing new features in POOMA as per
our kickoff meeting.

Smith will isolate, and hopefully fix, John Hall's scalar code
problem.  In addition, Smith will analyze a request from John Hall for
a new feature allowing the mixing of fields with different guard
layers in stencils and scalar code.

Oldham and Cummings will work on implementing the Field and Particle
kernels, respectively.

Issues
======

No progress has been made on security clearances.  Who should we
contact in order to make progress on this front?
