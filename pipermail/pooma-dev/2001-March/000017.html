</I>
I'm not at all sure about the status of anything under the &quot;r2/test&quot;
directory. Once upon a time we had a testing team and under their auspices
we formed the r2/test directory. This was supposed to test things based on
specifications; i.e. it was supposed to be somewhat black-box, whereas the
unit tests (src/Engine/tests, etc) were written by the developers and were
pretty much white-box. This process did not work out (we spent more time
debugging the test-team's test codes than we did debugging the things they
were testing). I don't even know if these were included in Graham Mark's
regression tests or in the distribution - I'm guessing not. In other words,
this is probably not a big deal as we may want to nuke r2/test.

Given that, I'll make a comment or two...

&gt;<i> Array/Test/ArrayTest.cpp:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Prepend iostream functions with &quot;std::&quot;.
</I>
This is not needed since we include &lt;iostream.h&gt; and not &lt;iostream&gt;. We did
this on purpose. At the time, some systems did not yet supporting the ANSI
iostreams. I seem to recall that this was particularly an issue with SGI's
CC.  Ah, yes, here is the text of my message on this:

&gt;<i> Matt Austern said that 7.2.1 beta 2 should definitely have some (not all)
</I>&gt;<i> of the .h-less header files. However, SGI has decided to only put things in
</I>&gt;<i> the std:: namespace if they are conforming. Their streams are not, so they
</I>&gt;<i> don't put streams in the std:: namespace. Almost everyone thought this was
</I>&gt;<i> a dumb idea, but I don't know if anyone convinced Matt.
</I>
Even though SGI isn't the platform of the future at LANL, it is the platform
of the present, and so we don't want to break things there. I guess we need
to check if this has been fixed in SGI CC. If not, we probably need to stick
with the current practice of include &lt;iostream.h&gt;.

As a practical matter, even if we go to &lt;iostream&gt; I'd prefer a

  using std::cout;
  using std::endl;

approach to writing &quot;std::&quot; in a million places in these test files.

&gt;<i> Shared/dclock.cpp:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Rewrite from non-portable SGI code to (hopefully) portable Gnu C
</I>&gt;<i> Library code.
</I>
I'm not sure about this code, but there are places where we used SGI's
high-speed timers and I think we want to keep that code. I think that those
places all provide portable versions, though.

&gt;<i> Utilities/RefCounting/RefCountedBlockPtr/RefCountedBlockPtrTest.cpp:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Change abs() to fabs() for floating point numbers.
</I>
Stroustrup says &lt;cmath&gt; and &lt;math.h&gt; are supposed to include

  double abs(double);

Is that not true.
