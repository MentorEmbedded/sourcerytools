Hello all,

I've been working my way through the Pooma code from the bottom up, starting
with Domain (which I don't pretend to fully understand yet) and progressing
recently through Layout and Partition.

Tonight I noted a potential performance issue within the Mapper
implementation.  But first, I want to start with an architectural
observation about contexts.

As far as I can see within my narrow horizons, contexts are just integer
values obtained via Pooma::context() which can be assigned into Nodes to
determine how [some sub-Domain operation I haven't discovered yet] is
eventually scheduled.

What I found interesting is that there does not appear to be any kind of
Context data structure which can be informed about what work units (nodes)
have been assigned into each context.  Without having this structure as a
reference point, it's not clear to me how the system can collect information
about the effectiveness of the different mapping heuristics.

A second consequence of not having a Context data structure is that each
mapping becomes an independent event.  If a context is already under a
larger than average work assignment there is no way to discover or avert
this as additional slabs of data are sliced and diced.

My observation about the Mapper implementation is that a built-in bias
exists which causes low numbered contexts to receive more than their fair
share of node assignments.

I haven't read all this code yet.  The two modules I've looked at tonight
are UniformMapper.cmpl.cpp and DistributedMapper.h

UniformMapper.cmpl.cpp(57)
  if (c &lt; remainder)
    templist[index++]-&gt;context() = c;

The effect of this line is to assign the extra &quot;remainder&quot; contexts to the
low numbered contexts 0..remainder-1.

DistributedMapper.h(65)
  // if there are more contexts than patches, assign one
  // patch per context for as many patches as there are
  ...
  // we should probably alert the user here!
  npc = 1;
  ncontexts = templist.size();

npc is the number of patches assigned per context.  We see the same effect
again that the uneven assignments are onto contexts 0..templist.size()-1.

I suspect that higher dimensionality objects might compound this issue.
Suppose we have a three dimensional array of size (101,101,101) and we
partition each dimension into ten segments.  If this works the way I think
it does, this process would create 1000 nodes (guard cells ignored).  Most
of the nodes would be 10x10x10 in size.  But there would also be one node
11x11x11 in size.  This is a fairly substantial 30% extra work if the
largest node were rate limiting.  If the partitioning logic has the same
bias (putting the larger nodes first in the mapper lists) these two effects
could be compounding negatively.

My suggestion is that we use stochastic mapping for determining which
contexts take on the &quot;round-off&quot; nodes.  This is a fairly standard procedure
in Internet proxy caches (where load balancing _really_ matters ;-) and
there are many good algorithms for doing this.

If we are in a situation where more than one context must determine the same
mappings in parallel we would need to take special care to ensure that the
PRNG behaves consistently in each independent context.  The bullet-proof
approach is to embed a PRNG object inside the ContextMapper base class so
that each Mapper only depends on receiving the same map requests in the same
order.  If there is a higher level of parallel determinism, a global PRNG
would suffice.

One of the properties in the algorithms I've inspected is that the Node list
is partitioned among the available contexts in contiguous segments.  (Does
this matter?)  To retain this property we need an algorithm which is
sequential by context.  Let M = floor(nodes/contexts) and R =
nodes%contexts.  Each context will be assigned either M or M+1 consecutive
nodes from the node list.

In the present implementation of UniformMapper, contexts 0..R-1 are assigned
M+1 nodes and the rest of the contexts are assigned M nodes.

The simple stochastic algorithm uses a helper structure P, which is a
(deterministically) random permutation of a bit vector (values 0 and 1) of
length equal to the number of contexts which sums to R.

Context c is assigned M nodes if P[c] == 1; M+1 nodes if P[c] == 1.

There are a variety of efficient methods to generate P.

My second suggestion is that context-to-node bindings be made through some
kind of function call which could, at some point in the future, also notify
a global Context data structure about Node assignments accrued.  In the
meantime, one could at least toss a trace statement at such a control point
to determine, for example, whether the Mapper issues I've identified are a
practical concern.
