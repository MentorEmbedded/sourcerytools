<PRE>Allan,

I suspect the problems are due to conversions between VS5
and VS6 project files.  I thought I converted everything
over to VS6 successfully, but maybe not.  I will check on
that today.

Incidentally, are you working with the CVS repository in
a Windows environment?  If so, perhaps you could help me
figure out how to get WinCVS and SSH to play nice together.
I only have read-only access to the repository via my
Windows machine right now.  I was hoping to work with VS6
and Intel VTune (or perhaps gcc under cygwin) on my local
machine, rather than logging in to a Unix machine at Caltech
and working from there.  If you know the secrets, could you
please e-mail me instructions?

Thanks, Julian C.

Subject: [pooma-dev] problems loading Visual Studio projects



Hello everyone,

I'm slowly mastering the mechanics of working with the Pooma tree.  So far I
have CVS working with write access and I was able to compile Pooma in a
FreeBSD/gcc environment.  The test code is producing errors in this
environment, but that is the subject of another mail.

Yesterday I began the process of getting Pooma to compile in my w2k
environment.  I upgraded myself to Intel 5.0 and then tried to load the
VisualC++ workspaces into Visual Studio 6 for a test compile.

The workspaces file (.dsw) load without error, but I end up with an empty
workspace (no projects).  I was working in the benchmark workspace at the
time, so I thought I would just add maybe eight projects (.dsp files) into
this workspace manually.

When I try to load one of these project files into an empty workspace (I've
also tried this with a virgin workspace) VS6 complains that the &quot;project
file was not generated by VS6&quot; and offers to wrap the project file, a
process which creates a new .dsp file (which I save under a new name).

I can now load the new-and-improved .dsp project into my blank workspace,
but my workspace project tree still shows (0) projects loaded.  Recognizing
that I'm in the land of Lilliput, I checked the VS menus and sure enough VS6
has added an option to the menu for me to build the project which I still
can not see under my project tree.

If I try to compile the phantom project via the menu option, I get
complaints pertaining to NMAKE.  Whoa, one problem at a time.

Working in this environment a few weeks ago, but with Intel 4.5 installed
instead, I was able to load and compile these same workspaces from the 2.3
Pooma off the internet.  Either Intel 5.0 has &quot;enhanced&quot; Visual Studio, or
something has changed in the structure of the .dsp files incorporated into
the r2 checkout tree.

If someone can send me a &quot;works for me&quot; against the r2 tree, then I can
resume banging my head against the wall in my own corner of the room without
concern that I'm duplicating effort.

Allan
