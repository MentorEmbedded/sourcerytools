<PRE>Allan,

Back up a bit and tell me where to download
the specific version of cygwin that you are
using.  Does it come with both ssh and cvs?

Julian C.

&lt;&lt;&lt;
Incidentally, are you working with the CVS repository in
a Windows environment?  If so, perhaps you could help me
figure out how to get WinCVS and SSH to play nice together.
I only have read-only access to the repository via my
Windows machine right now.

I was hoping to work with VS6
and Intel VTune (or perhaps gcc under cygwin) on my local
machine, rather than logging in to a Unix machine at Caltech
and working from there.  If you know the secrets, could you
please e-mail me instructions?
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
I have used several methods in the past, but I've haven't used WinCVS
before.  I don't see any reason why WinCVS would respect the usual settings.

The easiest method recently is the new Cygwin.  The version of Cygwin I'm
using presently I downloaded under a directory named 1.8, supposing that
means anything.  It comes with a very up-to-date version of SSH:
OpenSSH_2.3.0p1

My ENV settings are as follows:

  export CVSROOT=:ext:pooma:/home/pooma/Repository
  export CVS_RSH=&quot;/usr/bin/ssh&quot;

I put these in a file and activate them with the bash &quot;source&quot; command.

In your USER directory (cygwin set me up under /home/administrator) add the
.ssh directory with your Pooma public key identity.  My identity files are
called pooma and pooma.pub

I also added into ~/.ssh/config this option block:

Host pooma
  Hostname pooma.codesourcery.com
  EscapeChar none
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/pooma
  User pooma

If you have this working and your public key is set up at both ends, you can
do this:

  $ ssh pooma
  Enter passphrase for RSA key '<A HREF="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pooma-dev">allan at camel.wloo.nat</A>'

If it asks for a password instead of a passphrase, you're hosed.

  ssh -v -v pooma

Will do the whole process again with everything of interest printed to the
console.

If you do enter the passphrase you'll be stuck at an empty prompt.  Mark has
cleverly set up cvs to do a forced &quot;cvs server&quot; command, so no shell games
here.  An empty prompt means it worked.

As far as CVS is concerned, you just to get it to call the right SSH and to
have the right ENV variables set at the time SSH is called.  The crucial ENV
var for Cygwin SSH is USER=your_path.  There may be others, but these are
set up correctly by default if you are working *within* the Cygwin bash
shell.

&lt;smokes a cigar&gt;

Well, I tried wincvs myself for ten minutes.  Good luck.  The SSH
integration is minimal at best.

First, you'll need to set your Windows path to include c:\cygwin\bin  WinCVS
uses the windows path to locate SSH.

Next, your RSA identity needs to be c:\cygwin\home\administrator\.ssh\pooma
(match to your w2k username and identity file).

Finally, you'll need the patience of Job to determine what environment
variables are configured (and what vars are required) when WinCVS invokes
whatever SSH it finds in the PATH.  The usual message &quot;end of file from
server&quot; just means that _something_ wasn't correct.

Subject: [pooma-dev] problems loading Visual Studio projects



Hello everyone,

I'm slowly mastering the mechanics of working with the Pooma tree.  So far I
have CVS working with write access and I was able to compile Pooma in a
FreeBSD/gcc environment.  The test code is producing errors in this
environment, but that is the subject of another mail.

Yesterday I began the process of getting Pooma to compile in my w2k
environment.  I upgraded myself to Intel 5.0 and then tried to load the
VisualC++ workspaces into Visual Studio 6 for a test compile.

The workspaces file (.dsw) load without error, but I end up with an empty
workspace (no projects).  I was working in the benchmark workspace at the
time, so I thought I would just add maybe eight projects (.dsp files) into
this workspace manually.

When I try to load one of these project files into an empty workspace (I've
also tried this with a virgin workspace) VS6 complains that the &quot;project
file was not generated by VS6&quot; and offers to wrap the project file, a
process which creates a new .dsp file (which I save under a new name).

I can now load the new-and-improved .dsp project into my blank workspace,
but my workspace project tree still shows (0) projects loaded.  Recognizing
that I'm in the land of Lilliput, I checked the VS menus and sure enough VS6
has added an option to the menu for me to build the project which I still
can not see under my project tree.

If I try to compile the phantom project via the menu option, I get
complaints pertaining to NMAKE.  Whoa, one problem at a time.

Working in this environment a few weeks ago, but with Intel 4.5 installed
instead, I was able to load and compile these same workspaces from the 2.3
Pooma off the internet.  Either Intel 5.0 has &quot;enhanced&quot; Visual Studio, or
something has changed in the structure of the .dsp files incorporated into
the r2 checkout tree.

If someone can send me a &quot;works for me&quot; against the r2 tree, then I can
resume banging my head against the wall in my own corner of the room without
concern that I'm duplicating effort.

Allan
