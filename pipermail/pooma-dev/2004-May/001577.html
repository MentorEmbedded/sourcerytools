<PRE>|<i> Note that without your debugging stuff in the constructors, these
</I>|<i> get inlined and optimized away by the optimizer.  Of course one
</I>|<i> could argue creating the copies should be avoided in the first
</I>|<i> place, but I cannot see how this can be done, as, f.i. for
</I>|<i> BinaryOp&lt;Vector1, Vector2, OpMultiply&gt;::operator() we clearly need
</I>|<i> to return a _new_ Vector as result.  To avoid this one would have
</I>|<i> to expression-template the vector itself, so only primitive
</I>|<i> variable types are ever copied.  But I don't think this will work
</I>|<i> or pay off.
</I>

I actually compiled the code with the original (unmodified) version of 
Vector.h first and used GDB to run it and disassemble it. Without 
much analysing, I noticed several looping jumps at the place of the 
algebraic expression which only confirms that the optimising compiler 
did not produce the required code:
v2(0) = v1(0)*v1(0) + v1(0)*v1(0);
v2(1) = v1(1)*v1(1) + v1(1)*v1(1);
as was supposed to. (And I also tried several other optimisation 
configurations, of course.)

As to the need for the return of a Vector, I suppose that
Vector&lt;2, double, BinaryVectorOp&lt;...&gt; &gt; is all is needed (with the 
references to its two operands). There is no need at all to take this 
object and make its Full-engine copy for any subsequent operations.
