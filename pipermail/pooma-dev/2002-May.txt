Subject: Pooma/Cheetah and MPI
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0205021700150.26814-100000@bellatrix.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>

Hi!

I tried to use MPI to parallelize a pooma application and stumbeled
over the following problem:

A simple mpirun -np 4 myprog -mpi does not work, the first process
gets spawned, but just runs as in uniprocessor mode. The problem is,
the spawned processes dont get the -mpi parameter and such dont
call MPI_Init.

The problem is in Cheetah ControllerFactory::create which _removes_
the controller argument (-mpi) from the argument list and as such
the master MPI_Init and any further MPI_Init's dont see it.

I worked around this by manually re-inserting -mpi to the arguments
list in my program, but of course this is not a solution to the problem.
A fix would be to move the argument removal in Cheetah to _after_ the
MPI_Init call.

Anyone with a different solution to the problem? I'll happily contribute
the above suggestion, if nobody has a fix already.

Richard.

I believe Cheetah is still being actively developed at LANL. Check the
readme files in the Cheetah distribution - there should be some contact
information there somewhere. You might also check the www.acl.lanl.gov page.

Subject: Accessing remote parts of a Field
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0205031416210.26814-100000@bellatrix.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>

Hi!

I'd like to know how to access (efficiently) remote parts of a Field.
I.e. suppose I have a layout, I want to iterate through all sub-domains
and aquirie a local (read-only) copy of each domain.

Also the reverse operation, i.e. constructing locally the sub-domains
and transferring them to the appropriate remote location.

I need this for (serial) I/O.

Any suggestions?

Richard.

Subject: Memory overhead
Message-ID: <3CD807D3.3AD9FC4E@cns.mpg.de>

Hello,

can someone give me a rough estimation of what will be the memory
overhead for using Pooma::Arrays and Pooma::Fields.

For using small arrays/fields, my experiments showed that there seems to
be a constant base amount of about 6MB (using Pooma v 2.3 on an Origin
2000 with SGI CC v 7.3).
For larger arrays/fields the ratio of memory needed theoretically for a
data set to the memory actually occupied showed roughly a 60% overhead
for the latter.

Is this reasonable ? Which parts of pooma require the additional memory
? First, I thought, the 60% increase would only happen when using Fields
and the underlying position arrays needed the extra memory,
but using arrays showed the same increase.

Also, the old tutorial states that all mesh classes have guard layers
the size of N/2, N being the number of vertices along an axis. For large
high-dimensional meshes, I think, this could be quite a large memory
overhead, if actually memory is allocated for the guard layers. Is
really memory allocated and if so, can this fixed guard layer size be
adjusted to what is really required prior to memory allocation ?

Thanks for any comments.

Hi!

I see there is a lot of in-source reference documentation (good!), but
its hard to find. Is the way the documentation is formatted usable by
any documentation-generating utility? I tried to throw doxygen at it, but
that doesnt recognize the comments. Did you use any such tools during
development?

If not, I'll probably change comments to be able to be recognized by
doxygen.

Hi!

I put my work-in-progress doxygenifizing the documentation inside
the pooma source online at

http://www.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/~rguenth/pooma-reference-documentation/

At the moment, mainly the summaries / class descriptions are available,
method documentation will follow as I need them.

Yes, its quite usable - maybe I need teach doxygen to better group
partially specialized templates, though.

Yes - I'll be able to hide classes from the documentation (though I
thought the reference documentation be useful for the developer of the
code, too - i.e. I'm actually going to implement HDF5 I/O, AMR and in
conjunction with that a generic (time) integrator scheme).

If anyone has hints which classes to hide or wants to contribute extra
documentation be my guest. I will see if I can make my local bitkeeper
tree available for cloning (need to talk to the sysadmins here).

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0205161653590.26814-100000@bellatrix.tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>

Hi!

How am I supposed to use CoordinateSystems like f.i. Cylindrical?
I see that the CoordinateSystems classes provide methods like
volume and distance taking Regions/Vectors in coordinates in the
respective coordinate system. But on the other hand a Mesh gets
initialized with a Cartesian domain only(?). And the
PositionTraits::Type_t of the Mesh always yields Cartesian components
as there is no place to specify an alternate coordinate system?

I'm confused...

Richard.

I do not think that full POOMA support for using different coordinate
systems was ever implemented.  (Will someone please correct me if I am
wrong?)

docs/tut-07.html describes using meshes, centerings, geometries, and
fields, but the new Field implementation might have made some of this
out-of-date.

The new Field interface, available from the POOMA CVS tree, permits
specifying the mesh so explicit control of the guard layers is
permitted.

Ok, did you have specific ideas on how to integrate support for different
coordinate systems? If yes, I'm happy to go the suggested way, else I need
to come up with ideas myself.

Also, were there ideas on how to actually support something like AMR? From
the current code I see that reduction operators for doing the neccesary
interpolation do not exist.

I believe Julien Cummings or Scott Haney was the person most involved
in coordinate systems.  I do not know if there is a suggested way.
