<PRE>Hi Allan,

I think you will find that the Blitz and Pooma stencil
mechanisms are fairly similar because we had many
discussions with Todd when these things were being
designed.  Our stencils have to deal with some extra
issues such as multipatch arrays and geometry info.

I don't think the varargs issue is such a big deal
for Domains.  The issue is with all the repetitive
constructors for Array, etc.  (Maybe this is what
you meant.)  In fact, the variable number of Domain
arguments are wrapped together by sending them off
to the magical &quot;combine&quot; function to make a complete
Domain of the proper dimensionality.

The repetitive constructors are annoying, but I don't
think it is good to shift this burden onto users by
forcing them to pre-package the constructor arguments.
Since the Array dimension is limited, this is not a
problem that spirals out of control.

The same problem pops up with Pooma Stencils and the
number of arrays involved in the stencil, as well as
with functions that are defined to operate on some
set of partricle attributes.  Here you do have a real
problem, because the number of Arrays involved is
potentially unlimited.  I might be missing something,
but I don't think the dummy arguments idea you mention
actually solves this problem.  You still need to know
how many of those arguments are real Arrays involved
in the stencil and how many are just dummy arguments.
Either that, or the dummy argument class has to be
sophisticated enough to have some dummy methods for
retrieving a patch, etc.  Anyway, I don't see what
the big deal is about default template arguments for
function templates.  Can't you just wrap the function
in a functor class and then use default template
arguments with the functor class template?

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [pooma-dev] template idiom in the Blitz stencils; TList as a
</I>&gt;<i> Domain simplification
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yesterday I read through the Blitz stencil implementation.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> relatively
</I>&gt;<i> uncomplicated.   The main trick is the use of #define tricks to make it
</I>&gt;<i> convenient to define user stencils.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a good example of one of the many dozens of prebuild
</I>&gt;<i> stencils which
</I>&gt;<i> Blitz includes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BZ_DECLARE_STENCIL_OPERATOR1(Laplacian3D, A)
</I>&gt;<i>     return -6.0 * A
</I>&gt;<i>       + A.shift(-1,0) + A.shift(1,0)
</I>&gt;<i>       + A.shift(-1,1) + A.shift(1,1)
</I>&gt;<i>       + A.shift(-1,2) + A.shift(1,2);
</I>&gt;<i> BZ_END_STENCIL_OPERATOR
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Laplacian3D becomes the name of the stencil.  The array A is the single
</I>&gt;<i> argument.  The offsets are applied by shifting the &quot;entire&quot; array.  Blitz
</I>&gt;<i> uses a trick internally to figure out what &quot;entire&quot; means.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first time a stencil is run, it is applied to a psuedo-array
</I>&gt;<i> which does
</I>&gt;<i> nothing but keep track of the range of offsets supplied.  Blitz then
</I>&gt;<i> restricts the stencil to the largest interior sub-array such that the
</I>&gt;<i> supplied shifts are legal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll write a short note describing the Blitz approach in more detail after
</I>&gt;<i> contrasting the Pooma stencils.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What caught my eye was a complaint, presumably by Todd, which is
</I>&gt;<i> reminiscent
</I>&gt;<i> of some ugly template constructs in the Domain module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /*
</I>&gt;<i>  * There are a lot of kludges in this code to work around the fact that
</I>&gt;<i>  * you can't have default template parameters with function templates.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Ideally, one would implement applyStencil(..) as:
</I>&gt;<i>  *
</I>&gt;<i>  * template&lt;class T_stencil, class T_numtype1, class T_array2,
</I>&gt;<i>  *    class T_array3, class T_array4, class T_array5, class T_array6,
</I>&gt;<i>  *    class T_array7, class T_array8, class T_array9, class T_array10,
</I>&gt;<i>  *    class T_array11&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  * void applyStencil(const T_stencil&amp; stencil, Array&lt;T_numtype1,3&gt;&amp; A,
</I>&gt;<i>  *    T_array2&amp; B = _dummyArray, T_array3&amp; C = _dummyArray, ......)
</I>&gt;<i>  *
</I>&gt;<i>  * and allow for up to (say) 11 arrays to be passed.  But this doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>  * appear to be legal C++.  Instead, 11 versions of applyStencil are
</I>&gt;<i>  * provided, each one with a different number of array parameters,
</I>&gt;<i>  * and these stubs fill in the _dummyArray parameters and invoke
</I>&gt;<i>  * applyStencil_imp().
</I>&gt;<i>  */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm quite certain that C++ doesn't allow this.  I vaguely recall
</I>&gt;<i> discussing
</I>&gt;<i> the point with John Spicer when I tried to something like this myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lately there's been some discussion of possible extensions to C++ on
</I>&gt;<i> comp.std.c++  I often have ideas about how C++ could be fixed,
</I>&gt;<i> but few which
</I>&gt;<i> are practical.  This is a case which could be handled quite easily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> template &lt;class T, class A = Dummy, class B = Dummy&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>   void applyStencil (T t, A a = Dummy(), B b = Dummy())
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Presently, default types are not allowed for function templates.  Default
</I>&gt;<i> types could be allowed in the role of providing a default type when the
</I>&gt;<i> argument position is not supplied in the call.  If the type had a
</I>&gt;<i> default in
</I>&gt;<i> this situation, then the default value would have somewhere to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is one mechanism which might help prevent clusters of redundant
</I>&gt;<i> function signatures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the ways in which Pooma goes against the grain is the use of domain
</I>&gt;<i> arguments in vararg contexts, much like Todd is doing here with stencil
</I>&gt;<i> arguments.  Aside from the possibility of salvaging Todd's trick, the C++
</I>&gt;<i> language has no reasonable mechanism for supporting vararg
</I>&gt;<i> parameter lists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the ideas I've been considering is the use of typelists to handle
</I>&gt;<i> this construct.  TLists are described in Andrei Alexandrescu's &quot;Modern C++
</I>&gt;<i> Design&quot;, chapter 3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A TList is a recursively defined list template.  You can think of
</I>&gt;<i> them as a
</I>&gt;<i> generalization of pair&lt;&gt;.  Andrei's Loki library includes a full set of
</I>&gt;<i> compile time TList manipulations: indexing, erasing, replacing, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the use of Tlists, Todd's function might look like something
</I>&gt;<i> like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> template&lt;class T_stencil, class TypeList&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  void applyStencil(const T_stencil&amp; stencil, TypeList&amp; L)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To call this function you need to package the varargs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   applyStencil (stencil, make_tlist(a1, a2, a3, a4));
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Loki has enough #defines on TList to support up to 50 parameters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I remember noticing somewhere in the Domain/Layout code situations where
</I>&gt;<i> seven instances of a member function where defined each with a different
</I>&gt;<i> vararg length, and each of the functions just passed the same parameters
</I>&gt;<i> through to another Pooma module, which presumably also defines
</I>&gt;<i> seven member
</I>&gt;<i> functions to handle all the ranks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There might be a case for adopting a TList mechanism to handle vararg
</I>&gt;<i> constructs in Pooma.  The TList itself contains all the nasty code
</I>&gt;<i> replication.  There would no longer be a need for Pooma components to
</I>&gt;<i> replicate member functions on rank.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know to what extend vararg constructs are currently
</I>&gt;<i> exposed in user
</I>&gt;<i> level contexts, or how much of an imposition it would be to
</I>&gt;<i> require users to
</I>&gt;<i> package their varargs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A possible compromise would be to retain the functions for 1 to 3
</I>&gt;<i> dimensions, and only require packaging for extended ranks.  Is
</I>&gt;<i> having three
</I>&gt;<i> versions any better than having seven?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm tossing this construct out first, because it's the least &quot;C++
</I>&gt;<i> compliant&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> of all the conveniences which Domain presently offers.  Allowing
</I>&gt;<i> integers to
</I>&gt;<i> act as a domain type is also a hassle, but at least it's a hassle the
</I>&gt;<i> language endorses.
