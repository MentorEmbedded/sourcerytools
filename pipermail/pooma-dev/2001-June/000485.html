Hi Allan,

Having one function would be wonderful from an implementation 
perspective; however, I believe that asking the users to package their 
domains would be viewed as ugly and onerous. Providing 7 versions of 
some functions really isn't all that big of a deal, certainly not 
significantly harder than providing 3.

I thought that our approach was C++-compliant. Could you explain where 
it falls short here?

As for integers appearing in a mix of domains, one could legitimately 
argue that this adds a lot of complexity that might better be handled in 
other ways: for example, having  slices require a specific syntax and 
doing indexing with a separate set of member functions.

I do like Todd's approach of defining the stencils. It probably wouldn't 
be horribly hard to try a similar thing with POOMA . Are you interested 
in pursuing a prototype of, say, a cell-&gt;cell divergence for comparison 
purposes?

Scott
