Subject: Problem with configure on Linux/ia32: Red Hat 8.0
Message-ID: <88E10B707C51824DA13AA135A402DF470109C33A@hdsmsx403.hd.intel.com>

Hi,

I hope that I am not asking a FAQ, but the FAQ doesn't appear to be
there yet...

I'm trying to build POOMA 2.4.0 on Linux/ia32, but am running into some
problems
with the configure and make. Here is my set-up

% perl --version
This is perl, v5.8.0 built for i386-linux-thread-multi

% make --version
GNU Make version 3.78.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.

% gmake --version
GNU Make version 3.79.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.

Here's what I tried:

% configure --arch LINUXgcc --opt --suite KO

% setenv POOMASUITE KO

// make causes these errors...
% make

{ Lots of warnings about mt1, mt2, mt3, mt4, mt5... }

make: /tmp/src/pooma-2.4.0/config/Shared/tail.mk:110: pipe: Too many
open files
/tmp/src/pooma-2.4.0/config/Shared/tail.mk:110: /config/Shared/rules.mk:
No such file or directory
make: /tmp/src/pooma-2.4.0/config/Shared/tail.mk:113: pipe: Too many
open files
make: *** No rule to make target `/config/Shared/rules.mk'.  Stop.

// gmake causes these errors...
% gmake

{ Similar warnings about mt1, mt2, mt3, mt4, mt5... }

gmake:
stat:/usr7/jpsulliv/src/pooma-2.4.0/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilit
ies/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilitie
s/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/
Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Ut
ilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Util
ities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilit
ies/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/Utilities/.../subdir.mk: File name too
long
gmake: *** No rule to make target `/config/Shared/rules.mk'.  Stop.

The gmake errors look more "interesting" and might provide more clues as
to what is wrong.

Let me know if you have any suggestions.
Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
-Jeff

Looks familiar, try removing lib/KO/depend.mk - maybe even configure 
spit out some messages about errors during dependency generation?

Also rather than the 2.4.0 release you probably want to check out 
current CVS as it has many bugs fixed (notably compilation issues with 
the intel compiler and upcoming gcc 3.4 release).

Hope this helps,

Richard.

OK, I think that did help (removing lib/KO/depend.mk)  Thanks!

I am interested in building with the Intel compiler (on Linux), so I
probably would be interested in the latest sources. Is there a config
file for this already (LINUXicc)? I was planning to just modify
LINUXgcc.

I wasn't able to check out the sources, though:

% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs at pooma.codesourcery.com:/home/pooma/Repository
login
Logging in to
:pserver:anoncvs at pooma.codesourcery.com:2401/home/pooma/Repository
CVS password:
cvs [login aborted]: connect to pooma.codesourcery.com(65.74.133.5):2401
failed: Connection timed out

If you have other ideas that I should try, please let me know.

Thanks again,
-Jeff

This morning, I did not have any difficulty using the directions at the 
bottom of http://www.codesourcery.com/pooma/pooma_download.  The 
password is 'anoncvs'.  If you still have problems, please send as much 
information as possible.  I believe cvs's '-v' option produces more 
information, which can be useful for debugging.

Subject: AltView* classes
Message-ID: <403F5B29.6040005@tat.physik.uni-tuebingen.de>

Hi!

Does anyone remember the exact reason for the existance of the AltView* 
classes in Array.h and Field.h?  Removing them and fixing their usage to 
use View* seems to work (full test with gcc 3.3 and 3.4 in progress).

Thanks,

Richard.

Thanks again for your help, but I am still having trouble checking out
the cvs sources. I also was unable to ping pooma.codesourcery.com (from
Linux).

% ping pooma.codesourcery.com

Could this be due to my corporate firewall or other security settings?
Is that the right IP address for the cvs server?

Thanks,

Pinging works for me from inside and outside codesourcery.com:

Here'a another question for anyone familiar with the development history 
here.

Array<3> a(5,5,5); a(LeftDomain<3>(1,2,3)) fails because LeftDomain (& 
correspondingly RightDomain) doesn't define NewDomain1_t.  Defining 
NewDomain1_t and specializing TemporaryNewDomain1 for Left/RightDomain<N> as 
is done for AllDomain fixes the compiler error, but I was concerned that 
there is some subtle reason why this wasn't done.  Unfortunately I'm having 
a very annoying problem with the Intel Windows compiler refusing to let me 
debug the change, it tells me no source code is available whenever I try to 
step into the view operation or set a breakpoint there.
