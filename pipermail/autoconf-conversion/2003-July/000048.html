Yes, of course.  I didn't mean to imply the shell was broken.

Sigh.  This is more than what I've bargained for.

In the short term, I still think either of the fixes I proposed should
be applied.  Actually, both of them.  We don't need to be sloppy about
accepting arguments in our own trees.

Even then, something still isn't being done correctly, but that's probably
unique to libstdc++-v3, and not config-ml.in's problem.
