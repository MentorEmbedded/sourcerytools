Well, mostly done.  People interesting in converting can now look there
to see what to do, what not to do, and what to consider possibly doing.

Also, look this over if you use DejaGNU at all:

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are,
by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
