Subject: Compilation of Codesourcery without uclibc
Message-ID: <9bde694e0911180627h4cfca5d6w75143348441368a9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I want to disable  uclibc from Build of codesourcery. I have disable
from Script file. But still it give error

/scratch/clm/2009q1-linux-lite/install/mips-linux-gnu/libc/uclibc
could not found. This happen in GCC 2nd phase Build.
Applying io_quotes_use            to linux/cm4000_cs.h
Applying io_quotes_use            to linux/usb/tmc.h
Applying io_quotes_use            to linux/usb/vstusb.h
Applying io_quotes_use            to linux/fs.h
The directory that should contain system headers does not exist:
  /scratch/clm/2009q1-linux-lite/install/mips-linux-gnu/libc/uclibc/usr/include
make[2]: *** [stmp-fixinc] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-gcc] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2


I do not want to change Source code i just want to change in script.

Regards
Naveen
