Subject: Tutorial to build a 'Hello World' on MIPS
Message-ID: <SNT132-w22335CF5B0072DD875D8F68D7F0@phx.gbl>


Hello,


I'm using CodeSourcery for MIPS (mips-elf-11-03.52) on an XP machine. As long as my code does not use any standard function, everything works fine (I am running this code on an emulator and on real hardware with no problem). 

The problem is I can't even compile a 'Hello World' if it uses printf, for instance. I have tried to follow the 'getting started' instructions to the letter, I have tried using the supplied linker scripts... Either I get linker errors or I get a program that crashes on gdb. I will save you a the details because what I need is a 'getting started' guide.

What I need is a step-by-step guide to compiling a 'Hello World' program on an unmodified, out-of-the-box install of code sourcery (mips-elf-11-03.52) on bare metal or just on anything that will work on gdb -- so at least I have a starting point that is known to work. 
If this information is available in the documentation I have failed to find it. I think many CodeSourcery users would benefit from this short tutorial that needs not be more than a few lines long. 

This operation (building a 'hello world') is extremely trivial in all other embedded C toolchains I have used so it must surely be trivial here too, but I just can't do it without your help. I am sure that many members of this forum can answer this request, and any help will be greatly appreciated.


Thank you very much.

Jos? A. Ruiz

Hello,


I finally made a working 'Hello World' and indeed it was easy once you know the right incantations 
and what functions you need to supply (write, fseek, fstat, etc.).

I'm still having trouble: the standard libraries are not compiled for mips1, I guess they are 
compiled for mips32. But that's another story and not what this post was about. 

I still think that a step-by-step guide would be very useful and a big time saver for newbies (like 
me, in this context). Any help will still be appreciated as I still don't know if I'd doing it the right way 
and will probably encounter trouble along the way -- to begin with I think I'll have to recompile 
newlib for mips1.

Thanks,

Jos? a. Ruiz

Subject: undefined reference to atan2f
Message-ID: <BANLkTim6LMy0EE-b31tR0_o679pUVDvd9w@mail.gmail.com>

  Hi

   I can not understand for the life of me why I can't get this linker to
grab certain functions, like for example the atan function. I know it has
something to do with the linker script I'm using, however when I let the
compiler link automatically the functions I'm am trying to use do get called
but the problem is that the linker defaults the start of the code to
0x0400000 which is WRONG, I need the code to start at 0x0000000.  I looked
at the default linker script that the tool is using and I copied that
"EXACT" code into my linker script but then it goes right back to giving me
the orginal error of undefined reference to 'atan2f'.  I have been strugging
with this for at leats two weeks now I really need someone to help me out
here.  I have included my code and linker scripts.  Below are the
commandline commands I am issuing.

mips-sde-elf-as -Os -mips1 startup.s -o startup.o
mips-sde-elf-g++ -Os -c -g -mtune=r3k -mips1 autopilot.cpp -o
cpu_cache_instructions.o
mips-sde-elf-ld  -Os -mips1 -T ph_spr3.ld startup.o cpu_cache_instructions.o
-o cpu_cache_instructions.elf
mips-sde-elf-objdump --disassemble --line-numbers --source
cpu_cache_instructions_Spr3.elf > disassembly_Spr3.list

The above commands give me the error undefined reference to atan2f at the
linker stage

************************************************************

However when I use the following commands

mips-sde-elf-as -Os -mips1 startup.s -o startup.o
mips-sde-elf-g++ -Os -g -mtune=r3k -mips1 autopilot.cpp -o
cpu_cache_instructions.elf
mips-sde-elf-objdump --disassemble --line-numbers --source
cpu_cache_instructions.elf > disassembly_Spr3.list

Everything compilers and links find.  I get the warning message "warning can
not find entry symbol __start; defaulting to 0x04000b0" The problem here is
the code is not starting at 0x00000000 like it needs to.

*********************** REMEMBER FINALLY *********************

When I use these commands...

mips-sde-elf-as -Os -mips1 startup.s -o startup.o
mips-sde-elf-g++ -Os -g -mtune=r3k -mips1 autopilot.cpp -o
cpu_cache_instructions.o
mips-sde-elf-ld  -Os -mips1 -T elfbtsmipn32.ld startup.o
cpu_cache_instructions.o -o cpu_cache_instructions.elf
mips-sde-elf-objdump --disassemble --line-numbers --source
cpu_cache_instructions.elf > disassembly_Spr3.list


using the linker script that I created using the ld --verbose comand and
just cutting and pasting.  I not only still get the undefined reference to
atan2f, error but I also get the warning "warning can not find entry symbol
__start; defaulting to 0x04000b0".  I know how to fix the latter in this
case just alter the script to start at 0x00000000, but I still can't seem to
get the linker to use/find the atan2f.


SOMEONE HELP PLEASE AND THANK YOU!!
